# text = John Betjeman , the future Poet Laureate , described her as " the essence of English girlhood " . Korda attended her opening - night performance , admitted his error , and signed her to a film contract , with the spelling of her name revised to " Vivien Leigh " . She continued with the play ; but , when Korda moved it to a larger theatre , Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience , and the play closed soon after .
