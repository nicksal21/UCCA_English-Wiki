With his next venture , Bowie , in the words of biographer David Buckley , " challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day " and " created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture " . Dressed in a striking costume , his hair dyed red , Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars — Ronson , Bolder and Woodmansey — at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth on 10 February 1972 .
