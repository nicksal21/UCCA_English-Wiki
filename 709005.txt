The album contained several apparently simple songs , including " Under the Red Sky " and " Wiggle Wiggle " . The album was dedicated to " Gabby Goo Goo " ; this was later explained as a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis , Desiree Gabrielle Dennis - Dylan , who was four at that time .
