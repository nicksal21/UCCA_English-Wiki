104000	Jolie suffered episodes of suicidal depression throughout her teens and early twenties.
104001	She felt isolated at Beverly Hills High School among the children of some of the area's affluent families, as her mother survived on a more modest income, and she was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.
104002	She found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she started to self-harm; later commenting, "I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."
104003	She also began experimenting with drugs; by the age of 20, she had tried "just about every drug possible," including heroin.
104004	Jolie has had a difficult relationship with her father.
104005	Due to Voight's marital infidelity and the resulting breakup of her parents' marriage, she was estranged from her father for many years.
104006	They reconciled and he appeared with her in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.
104007	In July 2002, Jolie - who had long used her middle name as a stage name to establish her own identity as an actress - filed a request to legally drop Voight as her surname, which was granted on September 12, 2002.
104008	In August of that year, Voight claimed his daughter had "serious mental problems" on Access Hollywood.
104009	In response, Jolie released a statement in which she indicated that she no longer wished to pursue a relationship with her father.
104010	She explained that because she had adopted her son Maddox, she did not think it was healthy for her to associate with Voight.
104011	In the wake of her beloved mother's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, Jolie again reconciled with her father after a six-year estrangement.
106000	She next appeared in the 1996 comedy Love Is All There Is, a modern-day loose adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in The Bronx, New York.
106001	In the road movie Mojave Moon (1996) she played a young woman who falls for Danny Aiello's middle-aged character, while he develops feelings for her mother, played by Anne Archer.
106002	That same year, Jolie also portrayed Margret "Legs" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film Foxfire after they beat up a teacher who has sexually harassed them.
106003	The Los Angeles Times wrote about her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."
106004	In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld.
106005	The movie was not well received by critics; Roger Ebert noted that "Angelina Jolie [...] finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be Blossom's girlfriend, and maybe she is."
106006	She then appeared in the television film True Women (1997), a historical romantic drama set in the American West and based on the book by Janice Woods Windle.
106007	That year, she also appeared as a stripper in the music video for "Anybody Seen My Baby?" by the Rolling Stones.
107000	Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997). She portrayed Cornelia Wallace, the second wife of Alabama Governor George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise.
107001	The film was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film.
107002	Jolie also received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance.
107003	In 1998, Jolie starred in HBO's Gia, portraying supermodel Gia Carangi.
107004	The film chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s.
107005	Vanessa Vance from Reel.com noted, "Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal - filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation - and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."
107006	For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award.
107007	She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.
20000	William Bradley "Brad" Pitt was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and is the son of Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a high school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company owner.
20001	The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Doug (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969). Born into a conservative household, he was raised as Southern Baptist, although he has since described himself as oscillating between atheism and agnosticism.
20002	Pitt has stated that his family's ancestry consists of "probably ... Irish-Scots-Germans who settled in the area ... I know we have some Seminole, and some Cherokee Indian, in us". Pitt has described Springfield as "Mark Twain country, Jesse James country", having grown up with "a lot of hills, a lot of lakes". Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, tennis, wrestling and swimming teams.
20003	He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.
20004	Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism, with a focus on advertising.
20005	As a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, he acted in several fraternity shows.
20006	As graduation approached, did not feel ready to settle down.
20007	loved films - "a portal into different worlds for me" - and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.
20008	Two weeks before earning his degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.
28000	While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.
28001	Pitt's onscreen career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out, No Man's Land and Less Than Zero.
28002	His television debut came in May 1987 with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.
28003	In November of the same year Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.
28004	He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall). Pitt described his character as "an idiot boyfriend who gets caught in the hay."
28005	Speaking of his scenes with McCall, Pitt later said, "It was kind of wild, because I'd never even met her before."
28006	Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.
28007	In the same year, the Yugoslavian-U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition.
28008	The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.
28009	Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.
28010	He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.
466000	Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is a retired American professional basketball player who played point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA Draft by the Lakers.
466001	He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s.
466002	Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award.
466003	After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.
466004	Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, twelve All-Star games, and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations.
466005	He led the league in regular-season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2.
466006	Johnson was a member of the "Dream Team", the U.S. basketball team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1992.
466007	After leaving the NBA in 1992, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that travelled around the world playing exhibition games.
466008	Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.
466009	He was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007.
466010	His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, were well documented.
466011	Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, broadcaster and motivational speaker.
466012	Johnson was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years, and was part of a group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012.
467000	Earvin Johnson Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan to Earvin Sr., a General Motors assembly worker, and Christine, a schoolcustodian.
467001	Johnson grew up in Lansing, and came to love basketball as a youngster, idolizing players such as Earl Monroeand Marques Haynes, and practicing "all day".
467002	Johnson was first dubbed "Magic" as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Lansing's Everett High School, when he recorded a triple-double of 36 points, 18 rebounds and 16 assists.
467003	After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious.
467004	In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27-1 win-loss record while averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game.
467005	Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, he decided to play close to home.
467006	His college decision came down to the University of Michigan and Michigan State University in East Lansing.
467007	He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when its coach Jud Heathcote told him he could play the point guard position.
467008	The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.
467009	Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major and on his desire to become a television commentator.
467010	Playing with future NBA draftees Greg Kelser, Jay Vincent and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25-5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA Tournament.
467011	The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky.
467012	During the 1978-79 season, Michigan State again qualified for the NCAA Tournament, where they advanced to the championship game and faced Indiana State University, which was led by senior Larry Bird.
467013	In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75-64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four.
467014	After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.9 assists per game, Johnson was drafted in the 1979 NBA Draft.
467015	After the 1994-95 season, Heathcote stepped down as coach of the Spartans, and on June 8, 1995, Johnson returned to the Breslin Center to play in the Jud Heathcote All-Star Tribute Game.
467016	He led all scorers with 39 points.
468000	Johnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers.
468001	Johnson said that what was "most amazing" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history.
468002	Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal.
468003	Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.
468004	The Lakers compiled a 60-22 record in the regular season and reached the 1980 NBA Finals, in which they faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who were led by forward Julius Erving.
468005	The Lakers took a 3-2 lead in the series, but Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 33 points a game in the series, sprained his ankle in Game 5 and could not play in Game 6.
468006	Paul Westhead decided to start Johnson at center in Game 6; Johnson recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals in a 123-107 win, while playing guard, forward, and center at different times during the game.
468007	Johnson became the only rookie to win the NBA Finals MVP award, and his clutch performance is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA history.
468008	He also became one of four players to win NCAA and NBA championships in consecutive years.
468009	Early in the 1980-81 season, Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn cartilage in his left knee.
468010	He missed 45 games, and said that his rehabilitation was the "most down" he had ever felt.
468011	Johnson returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach Pat Riley later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a "divided team". The 54-win Lakers faced the 40-42 Houston Rockets in the first round of playoffs, where Houston upset the Lakers 2-1 after Johnson airballed a last-second shot in Game 3.
469000	In 1981, after the 1980-81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $ 25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point.
469001	Early in the 1981-82 season, Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers "slow" and "predictable". After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley.
469002	Although Johnson denied responsibility for Westhead's firing, he was booed across the league, even by Lakers' fans.
469003	However, Buss was also unhappy with the Lakers offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the Westhead-Johnson altercation, but assistant GMJerry West and GM Bill Sharman had convinced Buss to delay his decision.
469004	Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and a league-high 2.7 steals per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team.
469005	He also joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to tally at least 700 points, 700 rebounds, and 700 assists in the same season.
469006	The Lakers advanced through the 1982 playoffs and faced Philadelphia for the second time in three years in the 1982 NBA Finals.
469007	After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4-2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award.
469008	During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2 points on.533 shooting, 10.8 rebounds, 8.0 assists, and 2.5 steals per game.
469009	Johnson later said that his third season was when the Lakers first became a great team, and he credited their success to Riley.
469010	During the 1982-83 NBA season, Johnson averaged 16.8 points, 10.5 assists, and 8.6 rebounds per game and earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination.
469011	The Lakers again reached the Finals, and for a third time faced the Sixers, who featured center Moses Malone as well as Erving.
469012	With Johnson's teammates Norm Nixon, James Worthy and Bob McAdoo all hobbled by injuries, the Lakers were swept by the Sixers, and Malone was crowned the Finals MVP.
469013	In a losing effort against Philadelphia, Johnson averaged 19.0 points on.403 shooting, 12.5 assists, and 7.8 rebounds per game.
470000	In Johnson's fifth season, he averaged a double-double of 17.6 points and 13.1 assists, as well as 7.3 rebounds per game.
470001	The Lakers reached the Finals for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's Celtics met for the first time in the post-season.
470002	The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18 seconds to go, but after a layup by Gerald Henderson, Johnson failed to get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124-121 in overtime.
470003	In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21 assists in a 137-104 win, but in Game 4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest.
470004	In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center Robert Parish, and then missed two free throws that could have won the game.
470005	The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games.
470006	In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard Dennis Johnson stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series.
470007	Friends Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre consoled him that night, talking until the morning in his Boston hotel room amidst fan celebrations on the street.
470008	During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0 points on.560 shooting, 13.6 assists, and 7.7 rebounds per game.
470009	Johnson later described the series as "the one championship we should have had but didn't get". In the 1984-85 regular season, Johnson averaged 18.3 points, 12.6 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game and led the Lakers into the 1985 NBA Finals, where they faced the Celtics again.
470010	The series started poorly for the Lakers when they allowed an NBA Finals record 148 points to the Celtics in a 34-point loss in Game 1.
470011	However, Abdul-Jabbar, who was now 38 years old, scored 30 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in Game 2, and his 36 points in a Game 5 win were instrumental in establishing a 3-2 lead for Los Angeles.
470012	After the Lakers defeated the Celtics in six games, Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson, who averaged 18.3 points on.494 shooting, 14.0 assists, and 6.8 rebounds per game in the championship series, said the Finals win was the highlight of their careers.
492000	David Robert Jones (born 8 January 1947), known by his stage name David Bowie, is an English musician, actor, record producer and arranger.
492001	Bowie has been a major figure in the world of popular music for over four decades, and is renowned as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s.
492002	He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work.
492003	Bowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when his song "Space Oddity" reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart.
492004	After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single "Starman" and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.
492005	Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, "challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day" and "created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture."
492006	The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.
492007	In 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single "Fame" and the hit album Young Americans, which the singer characterised as "plastic soul". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees.
492008	He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low (1977)-the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years.
492009	This so-called "Berlin Trilogy" albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
492010	After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single "Ashes to Ashes", its parent album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and "Under Pressure", a 1981 collaboration with Queen.
492011	He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, which yielded several hit singles.
492012	Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including blue-eyed soul, industrial, adult contemporary, and jungle.
492013	He has not toured since the 2003-04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006.
492014	Bowie's latest studio album The Next Day was released in March 2013.
493000	Buckley says of Bowie: "His influence has been unique in popular culture - he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure."
493001	In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was placed at number 29.
493002	Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 140 million albums.
493003	In the UK, he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and eight Silver, and in the US, five Platinum and seven Gold certifications.
493004	In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time", and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time.
493005	David Bowie was born David Robert Jones in Brixton, London, on 8 January 1947.
493006	His Irish mother, Margaret Mary "Peggy" (née Burns), worked as a cinema usherette, while his father, Haywood Stenton "John" Jones, was a promotions officer for Barnardo's.
493007	The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, located near the border of the south London areas of Brixton and Stockwell.
493008	Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child - and a defiant brawler.
493009	In 1953 the family moved to the suburb of Bromley, where, two years later, Bowie progressed to Burnt Ash Junior School.
493010	His voice was considered "adequate" by the school choir, and his recorder playing judged to demonstrate above-average musical ability.
493011	At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations "vividly artistic" and his poise "astonishing" for a child.
493012	The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, The Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley and Little Richard.
493013	Upon listening to "Tutti Frutti", Bowie would later say, "I had heard God". Presley's impact on him was likewise emphatic: "I saw a cousin of mine dance to ... 'Hound Dog' and I had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, the power of the music. I started getting records immediately after that."
493014	By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea - chest bass and begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry - complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists - to his local Wolf Cub group was described as "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet."
493015	Failing his eleven plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie joined Bromley Technical High School.
494000	It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford writes: Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] public school. There were houses, named after eighteenth-century statesmen like Pitt and Wilberforce. There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton.
494001	In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, Peter, to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.
494002	Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting.
494003	After Terry Burns, his half-brother, introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a plastic alto saxophone in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician.
494004	Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl.
494005	Doctors feared he would become blind in that eye.
494006	After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil.
494007	The latter condition has misled some to believe that Bowie has different coloured eyes, when in reality both irises are the same blue colour.[
494008	dead link] Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.
494009	Graduating from his plastic saxophone to a real instrument in 1962, Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15.
494010	Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.
494011	When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star.
494012	His mother promptly arranged his employment as an electrician's mate.
494013	Frustrated by his band-mates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees.
494014	He wrote to the newly successful washing - machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to "do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles - and make another million."
494015	Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.
495000	Conn quickly began to promote Bowie.
495001	The singer's debut single, "Liza Jane", credited to Davie Jones and the King Bees, had no commercial success.
495002	Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon blues numbers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul - "I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger", Bowie was to recall."
495003	I Pity the Fool" was no more successful than "Liza Jane", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by The Who. "
495004	You've Got a Habit of Leaving" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract.
495005	Declaring that he would exit the pop world "to study mime at Sadler's Wells", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third.
495006	His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, "Do Anything You Say". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included a Bowie number and Velvet Underground material, went unreleased.
495007	Ken Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.
495008	Dissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Bowie renamed himself after the 19th century American frontiersman Jim Bowie and the knife he had popularised.
495009	His April 1967 solo single, "The Laughing Gnome", using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart.
495010	Released six weeks later, his album debut, David Bowie, an amalgam of pop, psychedelia, and music hall, met the same fate.
495011	It was his last release for two years.
495012	Bowie's fascination with the bizarre was fuelled when he met dancer Lindsay Kemp: "He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus."
495013	Kemp, for his part, recalled, "I didn't really teach him to be a mime artiste but to be more of himself on the outside, ... I enabled him to free the angel and demon that he is on the inside."
495014	Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world.
495015	Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned "Over the Wall We Go" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year.
495016	After Kemp cast Bowie with Hermione Farthingale for a poetic minuet, the pair began dating; they soon moved into a London flat together.
495017	Playing acoustic guitar, she formed a group with Bowie and bassist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969, when Bowie and Farthingale broke up, the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime.
496000	Because of his lack of commercial success, Bowie was forced to try to earn a living in different ways.
496001	He featured in a Lyons Maid ice cream commercial, but was rejected for another by Kit Kat.
496002	Love You till Tuesday, was a 30-minute film featuring performances from his repertoire and was intended as a vehicle to promote the singer.
496003	Although the film was not released until 1984, the filming sessions in January 1969 led to unexpected success when Bowie told the producers, "That film of yours - I've got a new song for it."
496004	He then demoed the song that provided his commercial breakthrough. "
496005	Space Oddity" was released on 11 July, five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch, to become a UK top five hit.
496006	Breaking up with Farthingale shortly after completion of the film, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger.
496007	Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street.
496008	This soon morphed into the Beckenham Arts Lab, and became extremely popular.
496009	The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, later immortalised by Bowie in his song "Memory of a Free Festival". Bowie's second album, Space Oddity, followed in November; originally issued in the UK as David Bowie, it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled Man of Words/Man of Music. Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.
496010	Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969.
496011	They married within a year.
496012	Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating.
496013	Having established himself as a solo artist with "Space Oddity", Bowie began to sense a lacking: "a full-time band for gigs and recording-people he could relate to personally". The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with Marc Bolan, who was at the time acting as his session guitarist.
496014	A band was duly assembled.
496015	John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, was joined by Tony Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar.
496016	Known as The Hype, the band members created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of The Spiders From Mars.
496017	After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse, they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist.
496018	Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style; matters came to a head when Bowie, enraged, accused, "You're fucking up my album."
496019	Cambridge summarily quit and was replaced by Mick Woodmansey.
496020	Not long after, in a move that resulted in years of litigation, at the conclusion of which Bowie was forced to pay Pitt compensation, the singer fired his manager, replacing him with Tony Defries.
497000	The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, The Man Who Sold the World (1970). Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new backing band, it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by Space Oddity.
497001	To promote it in the United States, Mercury Records financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by radio stations and the media.
497002	Exploiting his androgynous appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress: taking the garment with him, he wore it during interviews - to the approval of critics, including Rolling Stone's John Mendelsohn who described him as "ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall" - and in the street, to mixed reaction including laughter and, in the case of one male pedestrian, producing a gun and telling Bowie to "kiss my ass". During the tour Bowie's observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing "the ultimate pop idol". A girlfriend recalled his "scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character "who looks like he's landed from Mars". Hunky Dory (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's producer and bassist, supplanted in both roles, by Ken Scott and Trevor Bolder respectively.
497003	The album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of "Space Oddity", with light fare such as "Kooks", a song written for his son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones, born on 30 May. (His parents chose "his kooky name" - he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years - after the Greek word zoe, life.)
497004	Elsewhere, the album explored more serious themes, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with "Song for Bob Dylan", "Andy Warhol", and "Queen Bitch", a Velvet Underground pastiche.
497005	It was not a significant commercial success at the time but was ranked number 58 by voters on the All Time Top 1000 Albums list.
498000	With his next venture, Bowie, in the words of biographer David Buckley, "challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day" and "created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture". Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed red, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars-Ronson, Bolder and Woodmansey - at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth on 10 February 1972.
498001	The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the course of the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a "cult of Bowie" that was "unique - its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."
498002	The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory, was released in June. "
498003	Starman", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song.
498004	The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old Hunky Dory.
498005	At the same time the non-album single "John, I'm Only Dancing", and "All the Young Dudes", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, became UK hits.
498006	The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States.
498007	Bowie contributed backing vocals to Lou Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough Transformer, co-producing the album with Mick Ronson.
498008	His own Aladdin Sane (1973) topped the UK chart, his first number one album.
498009	Described by Bowie as "Ziggy goes to America", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the United States during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album.
498010	Aladdin Sane spawned the UK top five singles "The Jean Genie" and "Drive-In Saturday".
499000	Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. "
499001	Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David."
499002	With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust - and, later, the Thin White Duke - from his own character offstage.
499003	Ziggy, Bowie said, "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity."
499004	His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar.
499005	Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage "retirement" at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973.
499006	Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.
499007	After breaking up the Spiders from Mars, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona.
499008	His back catalogue was now highly sought: The Man Who Sold the World had been re-released in 1972 along with Space Oddity. "
499009	Life on Mars?", from Hunky Dory, was released in June 1973 and made number three in the UK singles chart.
499010	Entering the same chart in September, Bowie's novelty record from 1967, "The Laughing Gnome", reached number four.
499011	Pin Ups, a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in "Sorrow" and itself peaking at number one, making David Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK.
499012	It brought the total number of Bowie albums currently in the UK chart to six.
500000	Bowie moved to the United States in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles.
500001	Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music.
500002	The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits "Rebel Rebel" and "Diamond Dogs", and number five in the US.
500003	To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974.
500004	Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob.
500005	The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia and emotional problems.
500006	He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled "David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only In Theory". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US.
500007	It also spawned a UK number ten hit in Bowie's cover of "Knock on Wood". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.
500008	The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was Young Americans (1975). Biographer Christopher Sandford writes, "Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now."
500009	The album's sound, which the singer identified as "plastic soul", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees.
500010	Young Americans yielded Bowie's first US number one, "Fame", co-written with John Lennon, who contributed backing vocals, and Carlos Alomar.
500011	Lennon called Bowie's work "great, but just rock and roll with lipstick on". Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show Soul Train, Bowie mimed "Fame", as well as "Golden Years", his November single, that was offered to Elvis Presley to perform, but Presley declined it.
500012	Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single "Space Oddity" became Bowie's first number one hit in the UK a few months after "Fame" achieved the same in the US.
500013	Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, "for all his record sales (over a million copies of Ziggy Stardust alone), existed essentially on loose change."
500014	In 1975, in a move echoing Ken Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager.
500015	At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, "millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered" in what were "uniquely generous terms for Defries", then "shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door."
500016	Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.
501000	Station to Station (1976) introduced a new Bowie persona, the "Thin White Duke" of its title track.
501001	Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film The Man Who Fell to Earth the same year.
501002	Developing the funk and soul of Young Americans, Station to Station also prefigured the Krautrock and synthesiser music of his next releases.
501003	The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when Russell Harty interviewed the singer for his London Weekend Television talk show in anticipation of the album's supporting tour.
501004	Shortly before the satellite-linked interview was scheduled to commence, the death of the Spanish dictator General Franco was announced.
501005	Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed.
501006	This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead.
501007	In the ensuing conversation with Harty, as described by biographer David Buckley, "the singer made hardly any sense at all throughout what was quite an extensive interview. ... Bowie looked completely disconnected and was hardly able to utter a coherent sentence."
501008	His sanity - by his own later admission - had become twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year, and was withering physically to an alarming degree.
501009	Station to Station's January 1976 release was followed in February by a three-and-a-half-month concert tour of Europe and North America.
501010	Featuring a starkly lit set, the Isolar-1976 Tour highlighted songs from the album, including the dramatic and lengthy title track, the ballads "Wild Is the Wind" and "Word on a Wing", and the funkier "TVC 15" and "Stay". The core band that coalesced around this album and tour - rhythm guitarist Alomar, bassist George Murray, and drummer Dennis Davis - continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s.
501011	The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy.
501012	Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia.
501013	Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, the singer waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME.
501014	Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave.
501015	He later blamed his pro-Fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. "
501016	I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur ...". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs."
502000	Bowie moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of Lake Geneva.
502001	In the new environment, his cocaine use increased; so too did his interest in pursuits outside his musical career.
502002	He took up painting, and produced a number of post-modernist pieces.
502003	When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference.
502004	Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, "a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art .... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography". Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career.
502005	Working with Brian Eno while sharing an apartment in Schöneberg with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as his Berlin Trilogy.
502006	During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow-up Lust for Life, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.
502007	Low (1977), partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Kraftwerk and Neu!, evidenced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional.
502008	It received considerable negative criticism upon its release - a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's ex-manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent.
502009	Despite these forebodings, Low yielded the UK number three single "Sound and Vision", and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart, where it reached number two.
502010	Leading contemporary composer Philip Glass described Low as "a work of genius" in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his Symphony No. 1 "Low"; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996 Symphony No. 4 "Heroes". Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating "fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces".
503000	Echoing Low's minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, "Heroes" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp.
503001	Like Low, "Heroes" evinced the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin.
503002	Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK.
503003	Its title track, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French.
503004	Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show Marc, and again two days later for Bing Crosby's televised Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in "Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy", a version of "The Little Drummer Boy" with a new, contrapuntal verse.
503005	Five years later, the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at number three on Christmas Day, 1982.
503006	After completing Low and "Heroes", Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries.
503007	By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."
503008	Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage, released the same year.
503009	The final piece in what Bowie called his "triptych", Lodger (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era.
503010	The result was a complex mixture of New Wave and World Music, in places incorporating Hejaz non-Western scales.
503011	Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from Bowie's early composition "All the Young Dudes" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.
503012	The album was recorded in Switzerland.
503013	Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, "It would be fair to call it Bowie's Sergeant Pepper ... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology."
503014	As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end - for fifteen years - of Bowie's partnership with Eno."
503015	Lodger reached number 4 in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles "Boys Keep Swinging" and "DJ". Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angela initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.
505000	Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) produced the number one hit "Ashes to Ashes", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from "Space Oddity". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club "Blitz" - the main New Romantic hangout - to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time.
505001	While Scary Monsters utilised principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically.
505002	The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Pete Townshend, Chuck Hammer and Tom Verlaine.
505003	As "Ashes to Ashes" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring in The Elephant Man.
505004	The same year, he made a cameo appearance in the German film Christiane F., a real-life story of teenage drug addiction in 1970s Berlin.
505005	The Christiane F. soundtrack album, which featured Bowie's music prominently, was released a few months later.
505006	Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, "Under Pressure". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number one single.
505007	Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1981 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal.
505008	Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal.
505009	In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, "Cat People (Putting Out Fire)", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK top 30.
505010	Bowie reached a new peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.
505011	Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US.
505012	Its three singles became top twenty hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. "
505013	Modern Love" and "China Girl" made number two in the UK, accompanied by a pair of acclaimed promotional videos that, as described by biographer David Buckley, "were totally absorbing and activated key archetypes in the pop world. '
505014	Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young Aborigine couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene (a homage to the film From Here to Eternity), was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV.
505015	By 1983, Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day.
505016	Let's Dance was followed by the Serious Moonlight Tour, during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist Earl Slick and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms.
505017	The world tour lasted six months and was extremely popular."
505018	Stevie Ray Vaughan was guest guitarist playing solo on "Let's Dance".
506000	Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop.
506001	It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit "God Only Knows". The album bore the transatlantic top ten hit "Blue Jean", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, "Jazzin' for Blue Jean". Bowie performed at Wembley in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief.
506002	During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premièred, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. "Dancing in the Street" quickly went to number one on release.
506003	The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record "This Is Not America" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman.
506004	Released as a single, the song became a top 40 hit in the UK and US.
506005	Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners.
506006	It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song rose to number two in the UK charts.
506007	He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs.
506008	His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge.
506009	Peaking at number six in the UK, the album yielded the hits "Day-In, Day-Out" (his 60th single), "Time Will Crawl", and "Never Let Me Down". Bowie later described it as his "nadir", calling it "an awful album". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May.
506010	Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar.
506011	Critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing.
507000	Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s.
507001	A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels.
507002	The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on drums and bass respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust For Life.
507003	Though he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making.
507004	The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as "a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of neo-Nazis"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, "It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book."
507005	EMI complained of "lyrics that preach" as well as "repetitive tunes" and "minimalist or no production". The album nevertheless reached number three in the UK.
507006	Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance - among fans and critics alike - to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member.
507007	A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label.
507008	Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band.
507009	Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work.
507010	Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.
507011	In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angela, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend.
507012	Bowie recalled, "I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate."
507013	They married in 1992.
507014	Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second.
507015	Tin Machine II's arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be "in exquisite taste", "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless.
507016	Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.
508000	In April 1992 Bowie appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen frontman's death the previous year.
508001	As well as performing "Heroes" and "All the Young Dudes", he was joined on "Under Pressure" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part.
508002	Four days later, Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland.
508003	Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived.
508004	They settled in New York instead.
508005	1993 saw the release of Bowie's first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz and hip-hop influenced Black Tie White Noise.
508006	Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with Let's Dance producer Nile Rodgers, confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, hitting the number one spot on the UK charts and spawning three top 40 hits, including the top 10 song "Jump They Say". Bowie explored new directions on The Buddha of Suburbia (1993), a soundtrack album of incidental music composed for the TV series adaptation of Hanif Kureishi's novel.
508007	It contained some of the new elements introduced in Black Tie White Noise, and also signalled a move towards alternative rock.
508008	The album was a critical success but received a low-key release and only made number 87 in the UK charts.
508009	Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-industrial Outside (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder.
508010	Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved US and UK chart success, and yielded three top 40 UK singles.
508011	In a move that provoked mixed reaction from both fans and critics, Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February the following year, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist.
509000	Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 17 January 1996.
509001	Incorporating experiments in British jungle and drum 'n' bass, Earthling (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album became UK top 40 hits.
509002	Bowie's song "I'm Afraid of Americans" from the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release.
509003	The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring Reznor, contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US Billboard Hot 100.
509004	The Earthling Tour took in Europe and North America between June and November 1997.
509005	Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record "(Safe in This) Sky Life" for The Rugrats Movie.
509006	Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as "Safe" on the B-side of Bowie's 2002 single "Everyone Says 'Hi'". The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo's track "Without You I'm Nothing", co-produced by Visconti, with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.
509007	Bowie created the soundtrack for Omikron, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also appeared as characters.
509008	Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album 'Hours...' featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his "Cyber Song Contest" Internet competition, Alex Grant.
509009	Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica.
509010	Sessions for the planned album Toy, intended to feature new versions of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album was never released.
509011	Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen.
509012	Alexandria Zahra Jones, Bowie and Iman's daughter, was born on 15 August.
510000	In October 2001, Bowie opened The Concert for New York City, a charity event to benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks, with a minimalist performance of Simon & Garfunkel's "America", followed by a full band performance of "Heroes". 2002 saw the release of Heathen, and, during the second half of the year, the Heathen Tour.
510001	Taking in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual Meltdown festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director.
510002	Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, Television and The Dandy Warhols.
510003	As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's Low era.
510004	Reality (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the A Reality Tour, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004.
510005	Onstage in Oslo, Norway, on 18 June, Bowie was hit in the eye with a lollipop thrown by a fan; a week later he suffered chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Scheeßel, Germany.
510006	Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery, requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg.
510007	The remaining 14 dates of the tour were cancelled.
510008	Following recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie has reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio.
510009	He sang in a duet of his 1972 song "Changes" with Butterfly Boucher for the 2004 animated film Shrek 2.
510010	During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song "(She Can) Do That", co-written with Brian Transeau, for the film Stealth.
510011	He returned to the stage on 8 September 2005, appearing with Arcade Fire for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the CMJ Music Marathon.
510012	He contributed back-up vocals on TV on the Radio's song "Province" for their album Return to Cookie Mountain, made a commercial with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio, and joined with Lou Reed on Danish alt-rockers Kashmir's 2005 album No Balance Palace.
511000	Bowie was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 February 2006.
511001	In April, he announced, "I'm taking a year off - no touring, no albums."
511002	He made a surprise guest appearance at David Gilmour's 29 May concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
511003	The event was recorded, and a selection of songs on which he had contributed joint vocals were subsequently released.
511004	He performed again in November, alongside Alicia Keys, at the Black Ball, a New York benefit event for Keep a Child Alive, a performance that marks the last time Bowie performed his music on stage.
511005	Bowie was chosen to curate the 2007 High Line Festival, selecting musicians and artists for the Manhattan event, and performed on Scarlett Johansson's 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, Anywhere I Lay My Head.
511006	On the 40th anniversary of the July 1969 moon landing - and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with "Space Oddity" - EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting members of the public to create a remix.
511007	A Reality Tour, a double album of live material from the 2003 concert tour, was released in January 2010.
511008	In late March 2011, Toy, Bowie's previously unreleased album from 2001, was leaked onto the internet, containing material used for Heathen and most of its single B-sides, as well as unheard new versions of his early back catalogue.
511009	On 8 January 2013 (his 66th birthday), his website announced a new album, to be titled The Next Day and scheduled for release 8 March for Australia, 12 March for the United States and 11 March for the rest of the world.
511010	Bowie's first studio album in a decade, The Next Day contains 14 songs plus 3 bonus tracks.
511011	His website acknowledged the length of his hiatus, saying "In recent years radio silence has been broken only by endless speculation, rumour and wishful thinking ... a new record ... who would have ever thought it, who'd have ever dreamed it! After all David is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants ... when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell. Today he definitely has something to say."
511012	Producer Tony Visconti said 29 tracks were recorded for the album, some of which could appear on Bowie's next record, which he might start work on later in 2013.
511013	The announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of a single, "Where Are We Now?", written and recorded by Bowie in New York and produced by longtime collaborator Tony Visconti.
511014	A music video for the single was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler.
511015	The single topped the UK ITunes Chart within hours of its release, and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at No. 6, his first single to enter the top 10 for two decades, (since "Jump They Say" in 1993). A second video, "The Stars (Are Out Tonight)", was released 25 February.
511016	Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple.
511017	On 1 March, the album was made available to stream for free through iTunes.
511018	The Next Day debuted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, his first since Black Tie White Noise (1993), and is currently the fastest-selling album of 2013.
512000	According to The Times, Bowie has ruled out ever giving an interview again, with producer Visconti agreeing with the interviewer's suggestion that he is now Bowie's "voice on earth". Visconti also revealed to The Times that Bowie has no intention of going on tour, noting that all "he wants to do is make records."
512001	Biographer David Buckley writes, "The essence of Bowie's contribution to popular music can be found in his outstanding ability to analyse and select ideas from outside the mainstream - from art, literature, theatre and film - and to bring them inside, so that the currency of pop is constantly being changed."
512002	Buckley says, "Just one person took glam rock to new rarefied heights and invented character-playing in pop, marrying theatre and popular music in one seamless, powerful whole."
512003	Bowie's career has also been punctuated by various roles in film and theatre productions, earning him some acclaim as an actor in his own right.
512004	The beginnings of his acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician.
512005	Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, he was given the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise (later made into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders). In the black-and-white short The Image (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him.
512006	The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra.
512007	In 1976 he earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nic Roeg.
512008	Just a Gigolo (1979), an Anglo-German co-production directed by David Hemmings, saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (Marlene Dietrich) and put into her Gigolo Stable.
514000	Bowie portrayed physicist Nikola Tesla in the Christopher Nolan film, The Prestige (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century.
514001	He voice-acted in the animated film Arthur and the Invisibles as the powerful villain Maltazard, and lent his voice to the character Lord Royal Highness in the SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis television film.
514002	In the 2008 film August, directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, alongside Josh Hartnett and Rip Torn, with whom he had worked in 1976 for The Man Who Fell to Earth.
514003	Buckley writes, "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality."
514004	Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts in the 22 January 1972 issue of Melody Maker, a move which coincided with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust.
514005	In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said: "It's true - I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me."
514006	In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was "the biggest mistake I ever made" and "I was always a closet heterosexual". On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than his own feelings; as described by Buckley, he said he had been driven more by "a compulsion to flout moral codes than a real biological and psychological state of being". Asked in 2002 by Blender whether he still believed his public declaration was the biggest mistake he ever made, he replied: Interesting. [Long pause] I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer, and I felt that bisexuality became my headline over here for so long. America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.
514007	Buckley's view of the period is that Bowie, "a taboo-breaker and a dabbler ... mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock", and that "it is probably true that Bowie was never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual ... he did, from time to time, experiment, even if only out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'." Biographer Christopher Sandford says that according to Mary Finnigan, with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969, the singer and his first wife Angie "lived in a fantasy world ... and they created their bisexual fantasy."
514008	Sandford tells how, during the marriage, Bowie "made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women."
515000	From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie has employed a wide variety of musical styles.
515001	His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by not only rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley but also the wider world of show business.
515002	He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.
515003	Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, "Space Oddity", and later in the song "Heroes", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that "in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness."
515004	Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as "particularly deliberate and distinctive". Schinder and Schwartz call him "a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect." Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's chamaeleon-like nature is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics "arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section."
515005	Bowie plays many instruments, among them electric, acoustic, and twelve-string guitar; alto, tenor and baritone saxophone; keyboards including piano, synthesisers and Mellotron; harmonica, Stylophone, xylophone, vibraphone, koto, drums and percussion, and string instruments including viola and cello.
515006	Bowie's innovative songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development.
515007	A pioneer of glam rock, Bowie, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, has joint responsibility with Marc Bolan for creating the genre.
515008	At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement - historian Michael Campbell calls him "one of punk's seminal influences". While punk musicians trashed the conventions of pop stardom, Bowie moved on again - into a more abstract style of music making that in turn became a transforming influence.
515009	Biographer David Buckley writes, "At a time when punk rock was noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance, Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation."
515010	Bowie's record company sought to convey his unique status in popular music with the slogan, "There is old wave, there is new wave, and there is Bowie ..." Musicologist James Perone credits him with having "brought sophistication to rock music", and critical reviews frequently acknowledge the intellectual depth of his work and influence.
523000	On November 16, 1935, in the midst of preparing for a radio performance on the Shell Chateau Hour, Garland learned that her father, who had been hospitalized with meningitis, had taken a turn for the worse.
523001	Frank Gumm died the following morning, on November 17, leaving her devastated.
523002	Her song for the Shell Chateau Hour was her first professional rendition of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart," a song which would become a standard in many of her concerts.
523003	Garland next came to the attention of studio executives by singing a special arrangement of "You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)" to Clark Gable at a birthday party held by the studio for the actor.
523004	Her rendition was so well regarded that she performed the song in the all-star extravaganza Broadway Melody of 1938 (1937), singing to a photograph of him.
523005	MGM hit on a winning formula when it paired Garland with Mickey Rooney in a string of "backyard musicals."
523006	The duo first appeared together in the 1937 B movie Thoroughbreds Don't Cry as supporting characters.
523007	Judy was then put in the cast of the fourth of the Hardy Family movies as a literal girl next door to Rooney's character, Andy Hardy in Love Finds Andy Hardy, although Hardy's love interest was played by Lana Turner.
523008	They teamed as lead characters for the first time in Babes in Arms.
523009	They starred together in five additional films, including two more of the Hardy films.
523010	To keep up with the frantic pace of making one film after another, Garland, Rooney, and other young performers were constantly given amphetamines as well as barbiturates to take before going to bed.
523011	For Garland, this regular dose of drugs led to addiction and a lifelong struggle and contributed to her eventual demise.
523012	She later resented the hectic schedule and felt that her youth had been stolen from her by MGM.
523013	Despite successful film and recording careers, awards, critical praise and her ability to fill concert halls worldwide, she was plagued throughout her life with self-doubt and required constant reassurance that she was talented and attractive.
524000	In 1938, aged 16, she was cast as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939), a film based on the children's book by L. Frank Baum.
524001	In this film, she sang the song with which she would forever be identified, "Over the Rainbow."
524002	Although producers Arthur Freed and Mervyn LeRoy had wanted her from the start, studio chief Mayer tried first to borrow Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox but declined.
524003	Deanna Durbin was then asked but was unavailable, resulting in Garland being cast.
524004	She was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part, but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming.
524005	Her blue gingham dress was chosen for its blurring effect on her figure.
524006	Shooting commenced on October 13, 1938, and was completed on March 16, 1939, with a final cost of more than US$2 million.
524007	With the conclusion of filming, MGM kept Garland busy with promotional tours and the shooting of Babes in Arms, directed by Busby Berkeley.
524008	She and Rooney were sent on a cross-country promotional tour culminating in the August 17 New York City premiere at the Capitol Theater, which included a five-show-a-day appearance schedule for the two stars.
524009	The Wizard of Oz was a tremendous critical success, though its high budget and promotions costs of an estimated $4 million coupled with the lower revenue generated by children's tickets meant that the film did not make a profit until it was rereleased in the 1940s.
524010	At the 1940 Academy Awards ceremony, Garland received an Academy Juvenile Award for her performances in 1939, including The Wizard of Oz and Babes in Arms.
524011	Following this recognition, she became one of MGM's most bankable stars.
524012	In 1940, she starred in three films: Andy Hardy Meets Debutante, Strike Up the Band, and Little Nellie Kelly.
524013	In the latter, she played her first adult role, a dual role of both mother and daughter.
524014	Little Nellie Kelly was purchased from George M. Cohan as a vehicle for her to display both her audience appeal and her physical appearance.
524015	The role was a challenge for her, requiring the use of an accent, her first adult kiss, and the only death scene of her career.
524016	The success of these three films, and a further three films in 1941, secured her position at MGM as a major property.
525000	During this time Garland experienced her first serious adult romances. The first was with the band leader Artie Shaw.
525001	She was deeply devoted to him and was devastated in early 1940 when he eloped with Lana Turner.
525002	Garland began a relationship with musician David Rose, and on her 18th birthday he gave her an engagement ring.
525003	The studio intervened because he was still married at the time to the actress and singer Martha Raye.
525004	They agreed to wait a year to allow for his divorce to become final and were wed on July 27, 1941.
525005	Garland, who had aborted her pregnancy by him in 1942, agreed to a trial separation in January 1943, and they divorced in 1944.
525006	She was noticeably thinner in her next film, For Me and My Gal, alongside Gene Kelly in his first screen appearance.
525007	She was top billed over the credits for the first time and effectively made the transition from teenage star to adult actress.
525008	At the age of 21, she was given the "glamour treatment" in Presenting Lily Mars, in which she was dressed in "grown-up" gowns.
525009	Her lightened hair was also pulled up in a stylish fashion.
525010	However, no matter how glamorous or beautiful she appeared on screen or in photographs, she was never confident in her appearance and never escaped the "girl next door" image that had been created for her.
525011	One of Garland's most successful films for MGM was Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), in which she introduced three standards: "The Trolley Song", "The Boy Next Door", and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". Vincente Minnelli was assigned to direct, and he requested that makeup artist Dorothy Ponedel be assigned to Garland.
525012	Ponedel refined her appearance in several ways, including extending and reshaping her eyebrows, changing her hairline, modifying her lip line and removing her nose discs.
525013	She appreciated the results so much that Ponedel was written into her contract for all her remaining pictures at MGM.
526000	During the filming of Meet Me in St. Louis, after some initial conflict between them, Garland and Minnelli entered a relationship.
526001	They were married June 15, 1945, and on March 12, 1946, daughter Liza was born.
526002	In 1951, they divorced.
526003	The Clock (1945) was her first straight dramatic film, opposite Robert Walker.
526004	Though the film was critically praised and earned a profit, most movie fans expected her to sing.
526005	It would be many years before she acted again in a nonsinging dramatic role.
526006	Garland's other famous films of the 1940s include The Harvey Girls (1946), in which she introduced the Academy Award-winning song "On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe", and The Pirate (1948). During filming for The Pirate in April 1947, Garland suffered a nervous breakdown and was placed in a private sanitarium.
526007	She was able to complete filming, but in July she undertook her first suicide attempt, making minor cuts to her wrist with a broken glass.
526008	During this period, she spent two weeks in treatment at the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts For these and other episodes, Garland is thought to have suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder.
526009	Following her work on The Pirate, she completed three more films for MGM: Easter Parade (in which she danced with Fred Astaire), In the Good Old Summertime, and her final film with MGM, Summer Stock.
526010	Because of her mental condition, Garland was unable to complete a series of films.
526011	During the filming of The Barkleys of Broadway, she was taking prescription sleeping medication along with illicitly obtained pills containing morphine.
526012	It was around this time she also developed a serious problem with alcohol.
526013	These, in combination with migraine headaches, led her to miss several shooting days in a row.
526014	After being advised by her doctor that she would only be able to work in four-to-five-day increments with extended rest periods between, MGM executive Arthur Freed made the decision to suspend her on July 18, 1948.
526015	She was replaced by Ginger Rogers.
527000	Garland was cast in the film adaptation of Annie Get Your Gun in the title role of Annie Oakley.
527001	She was nervous at the prospect of taking on a role strongly identified with Ethel Merman, anxious about appearing in an unglamorous part after breaking from juvenile parts for several years, and disturbed by her treatment at the hands of director Busby Berkeley.
527002	Busby was staging all the musical numbers, and was severe with Garland's lack of effort, attitude and enthusiasm.
527003	Judy complained to Louis B. Mayer, trying to have Berkeley fired from the feature.
527004	She began arriving late to the set and sometimes failed to appear.
527005	She was suspended from the picture on May 10, 1949, and was replaced by Betty Hutton, who stepped in performing all the musical routines as staged by Busby Berkeley.
527006	Garland was next cast in the film Royal Wedding with Fred Astaire after June Allyson became pregnant in 1950.
527007	She again failed to report to the set on multiple occasions, and the studio suspended her contract on June 17, 1950.
527008	She was replaced by Jane Powell.
527009	Reputable biographies following her death stated that after this latest dismissal, she slightly grazed her neck with a broken water glass, requiring only a Band-Aid, but at the time, the public was informed that a despondent Garland had slashed her throat. "
527010	All I could see ahead was more confusion," Garland later said of this suicide attempt. "I wanted to black out the future as well as the past. I wanted to hurt myself and everyone who had hurt me."
527011	In October 1951, Garland opened in a vaudeville-style, two-a-day engagement at Broadway's newly refurbished Palace Theatre.
527012	Her 19-week engagement exceeded all previous records for the theater and was described as "one of the greatest personal triumphs in show business history."
527013	Garland was honored for her contribution to the revival of vaudeville with a Special Tony Award.
528000	In May 1952, her mother Ethel was featured in a Los Angeles Mirror story in which she revealed that while Garland was making a small fortune at the Palace, Ethel was working a desk job at Douglas Aircraft Company for $61 a week.
528001	They had been estranged for years, with Garland characterizing her mother as "no good for anything except to create chaos and fear" and accusing her of mismanaging and misappropriating her salary from the earliest days of her career.
528002	Garland's sister Virginia denied this, stating "Mama never took a dime from Judy."
528003	On January 5, 1953, Ethel Gumm was found dead in the Douglas Aircraft parking lot.
528004	She was 59 years old.
528005	Garland filmed a musical remake of the film A Star is Born for Warner Bros. in 1954.
528006	Garland and Sidney Luft, her then-husband, produced the film through their production company, Transcona Enterprises, while Warner Bros. supplied the funds, production facilities, and crew.
528007	Directed by George Cukor and costarring James Mason, it was a large undertaking to which she initially fully dedicated herself.
528008	As shooting progressed, however, she began making the same pleas of illness which she had so often made during her final films at MGM.
528009	Production delays led to cost overruns and angry confrontations with Warner Bros. head Jack Warner.
528010	Principal photography wrapped on March 17, 1954.
528011	At Luft's suggestion, the "Born in a Trunk" medley was filmed as a showcase for her and inserted over director Cukor's objections, who feared the additional length would lead to cuts in other areas.
528012	It was completed on July 29.
528013	Upon its September 29, 1954 world premiere, the film was met with tremendous critical and popular acclaim.
528014	Before release, it was edited at the instruction of Jack Warner; theater operators, concerned that they were losing money because they were only able to run the film for three or four shows per day instead of five or six, pressured the studio to make additional reductions.
528015	About 30 minutes of footage was cut, sparking outrage among critics and filmgoers.
528016	A Star is Born ended up losing money, and the secure financial position Garland had expected from the profits did not materialize.
528017	Transcona made no more films with Warner.
529000	Garland was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and in the run-up to the 27th Academy Awards, was generally expected to win.
529001	She could not attend the ceremony because she had just given birth to her son, Joseph Luft, so a television crew was in her hospital room with cameras and wires to televise her anticipated acceptance speech.
529002	The Oscar was won, however, by Grace Kelly for The Country Girl (1954). The camera crew was packing up before Kelly could even reach the stage.
529003	Groucho Marx sent her a telegram after the awards ceremony, declaring her loss "the biggest robbery since Brinks."
529004	TIME magazine labeled her performance as "just about the greatest one-woman show in modern movie history."
529005	Garland won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical for the role.
529006	Garland's films after A Star Is Born included Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) (for which she was Oscar- and Golden Globe-nominated for Best Supporting Actress), the animated feature Gay Purr-ee (1962), and A Child Is Waiting (1963) with Burt Lancaster.
529007	Her final film was I Could Go On Singing (1963), costarring Dirk Bogarde.
529008	Garland engaged Sid Luft as her manager the same year she divorced Minnelli.
529009	He arranged a four-month concert tour of the United Kingdom, where she played to sold-out audiences throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland.
529010	It included her first appearances at the renowned London Palladium, for a four-week stand in April.
529011	Although some in the British press chided her before her opening for being "too plump," she received rave reviews and the ovation was described by the Palladium manager as the loudest he had ever heard.
529012	Garland and Luft were married on June 8, 1952, in Hollister, California.
529013	Garland gave birth to Lorna Luft, herself a future actress and singer, on November 21, 1952, and to Joey Luft on March 29, 1955.
530000	Beginning in 1955, Garland appeared in a number of television specials. The first, the 1955 debut episode of Ford Star Jubilee, was the first full-scale color broadcast ever on CBS and was a ratings triumph, scoring a 34.8 Nielsen rating.
530001	She signed a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network.
530002	Only one additional special, a live concert edition of General Electric Theater, was broadcast in 1956 before the relationship between the Lufts and CBS broke down in a dispute over the planned format of upcoming specials.
530003	In 1956, Garland performed four weeks at the New Frontier Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip for a salary of $55,000 per week, making her the highest-paid entertainer to work in Las Vegas.
530004	Despite a brief bout of laryngitis, her performances there were so successful that her run was extended an extra week.
530005	Later that year she returned to the Palace Theatre, site of her two-a-day triumph.
530006	She opened in September, once again to rave reviews and popular acclaim.
530007	In November 1959, Garland was hospitalized, diagnosed with acute hepatitis.
530008	Over the next few weeks several quarts of fluid were drained from her body until, still weak, she was released from the hospital in January 1960.
530009	She was told by doctors that she likely had five years or less to live, and that even if she did survive she would be a semi-invalid and would never sing again.
530010	She initially felt "greatly relieved" at the diagnosis. "
530011	The pressure was off me for the first time in my life."
530012	However, she recovered over the next several months and, in August of that year, returned to the stage of the Palladium.
530013	She felt so warmly embraced by the British that she announced her intention to move permanently to England.
530014	Her concert appearance at Carnegie Hall on April 23, 1961, was a considerable highlight, called by many "the greatest night in show business history". The two-record Judy at Carnegie Hall was certified gold, charting for 95 weeks on Billboard, including 13 weeks at number one.
530015	The album won four Grammy Awards including Album of the Year and Best Female Vocal of the Year.
530016	The album has never been out of print.
531000	In 1961, Garland and CBS settled their contract disputes with the help of her new agent, Freddie Fields, and negotiated a new round of specials.
531001	The first, entitled The Judy Garland Show, aired in 1962 and featured guests Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.
531002	Following this success, CBS made a $24 million offer to her for a weekly television series of her own, also to be called The Judy Garland Show, which was deemed at the time in the press to be "the biggest talent deal in TV history."
531003	Although she had said as early as 1955 that she would never do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation.
531004	She was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the failure of A Star is Born meant that she received nothing from that investment.
531005	A successful run on television was intended to secure her financial future.
531006	Following a third special, Judy Garland and Her Guests Phil Silvers and Robert Goulet, Garland's weekly series debuted September 29, 1963.
531007	The Judy Garland Show was critically praised, but for a variety of reasons (including being placed in the time slot opposite Bonanza on NBC show) the lasted only one season and was canceled in 1964 after 26 episodes.
531008	Despite its short run, the series was nominated for four Emmy Awards.
531009	The demise of the series was personally and financially devastating for Garland.
531010	Garland sued Luft for divorce in 1963, claiming "cruelty" as the grounds.
531011	She also asserted that he had repeatedly struck her while he was drinking and that he had attempted to take their children from her by force.
531012	She had filed for divorce from Luft more than once previously, including as early as 1956, but had reconciled.
532000	With the demise of her television series, Garland returned to the stage.
532001	Most notably, she performed at the London Palladium with her then 18-year-old daughter Liza Minnelli in November 1964.
532002	The concert, which was also filmed for British television network ITV, was one of her final appearances at the venue.
532003	She made guest appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show.
532004	Garland guest-hosted an episode of The Hollywood Palace with Vic Damone.
532005	She was invited back for a second episode in 1966 with Van Johnson as her guest.
532006	Issues with Garland's behavior ended her Hollywood Palace guest appearances.
532007	A 1964 tour of Australia was largely disastrous.
532008	Garland's first concert in Sydney, held in the Sydney Stadium because no concert hall could accommodate the crowds who wanted to see her, went well and received positive reviews.
532009	Her second performance, in Melbourne, started an hour late.
532010	The crowd of 7,000, angered by her tardiness and believing her to be drunk, booed and heckled her, and she fled the stage after just 45 minutes.
532011	She later characterized the Melbourne crowd as "brutish."
532012	A second concert in Sydney was uneventful but the Melbourne appearance garnered her significant bad press.
532013	Some of that bad press was deflected by the announcement of a near fatal episode of pleurisy.
532014	Garland's tour promoter Mark Herron announced that they had married aboard a freighter off the coast of Hong Kong; however, she was not legally divorced from Luft at the time the ceremony was performed.
532015	The divorce became final on May 19, 1965, and she and Herron did not legally marry until November 14, 1965; they separated six months later.
532016	In February 1967, Garland was cast as Helen Lawson in Valley of the Dolls for 20th Century Fox.
532017	During the filming, she missed rehearsals and was fired in April, replaced by Susan Hayward.
532018	Her prerecording of the song "I'll Plant My Own Tree" survived, along with her wardrobe tests.
533000	Returning to the stage, Garland made her last appearances at New York's Palace Theatre in July, a 16-show stand, performing with her children Lorna and Joey Luft.
533001	She wore a sequined pantsuit on stage for this tour, which was part of the original wardrobe for her character in Valley of the Dolls.
533002	By early 1969, Garland's health had deteriorated.
533003	She performed in London at the Talk of the Town nightclub for a five-week run and made her last concert appearance in Copenhagen during March 1969.
533004	She married her fifth and final husband, musician Mickey Deans, at Chelsea Register Office, London, on March 15, 1969, her divorce from Herron having been finalized on February 11.
533005	On June 22, 1969, Garland was found dead by Deans in the bathroom of their rented house in Chelsea, London.
533006	At the subsequent inquest, coroner Gavin Thursdon stated that the cause of death was "an incautious self-overdose" of barbiturates; her blood contained the equivalent of ten 1.5-grain (97 mg) Seconal capsules.
533007	Thursdon stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and that there was no evidence to suggest she had committed suicide.
533008	Her autopsy showed that there was no inflammation of her stomach lining and no drug residue there, which indicated that the drug had been ingested over a long period of time, rather than in one dose.
533009	Her death certificate stated that her death had been "accidental."
533010	Even so, a British specialist who had attended her said she had been living on borrowed time owing to cirrhosis.
533011	She had turned 47 just twelve days before her death.
533012	Her Wizard of Oz costar Ray Bolger commented at her funeral, "She just plain wore out."
533013	On June 26, Deans took Garland's remains to New York City, where an estimated 20,000 people lined up for hours at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan to pay their respects.
533014	On June 27, James Mason gave a eulogy at the funeral, an Episcopal service led by the Rev. Peter A. Delaney of St Marylebone Parish Church, London, who had officiated at her marriage to Deans.
533015	The public and press were barred.
533016	She was interred in a crypt in the community mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery, in Hartsdale, New York.
534000	Garland's legacy as a performer and a personality has endured long after her death.
534001	The American Film Institute named her eighth among the Greatest Female Stars of All Time.
534002	She has been the subject of over two dozen biographies since her death, including the well-received Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir by her daughter, Lorna Luft, whose memoir was later adapted into the television miniseries Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows, which won Emmy Awards for the two actresses portraying her (Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis). Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.
534003	Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
534004	These include "Over the Rainbow", which was ranked as the number one movie song of all time in the American Film Institute's "100 Years...100 Songs" list.
534005	Four more Garland songs are featured on the list: "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (#76), "Get Happy" (#61), "The Trolley Song" (#26), and "The Man That Got Away" (#11). She has twice been honored on U.S. postage stamps, in 1989 (as Dorothy) and again in 2006 (as Vicki Lester from A Star Is Born). Garland always had a large base of fans in the gay community and has become a gay icon.
534006	Reasons often given for her standing, especially among gay men, are admiration of her ability as a performer, the way her personal struggles mirrored those of gay men in America during the height of her fame and her value as a camp figure.
534007	When asked in the 1960s about how she felt about having a large gay following by Irv Kupcinet she famously said, "I couldn't care less. I sing to people."
534008	Some have also suggested a connection between the date of Garland's death and funeral on June 27, 1969 and the Stonewall riots, the flashpoint of the modern Gay Liberation movement, which started in the early hours of June 28.
534009	In a 2009 interview gay historian David Carter stated that this connection is untrue, and based on a mocking reference to the riot by an anti-gay writer in the Village Voice the next day.
534010	However the same historical documentary states that there were several patrons at the Stonewall bar that night, Garland fans who, according to bar patron Sylvia Rivera had come from the Garland funeral earlier in the day to drink and mourn.
534011	Rivera said that indeed there was a feeling in the air that something would happen that night: "I guess Judy Garland's death just really helped us really hit the fan."
534012	The two events are deeply connected in the lore of the gay community.
544000	As the 1930s came to an end, both Jack and Harry Warner became increasingly alarmed over the rise of Nazism.
544001	As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, "as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of anti-Semitic pogroms ... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism."
544002	Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism had a long history with the Warners that predated their production in 1918 of My Four Years in Germany.
544003	In 1917, while still in distribution War Brides, the Warners had secured the rights for, a film that featured Alla Nazimova as "a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic."
544004	Beyond this, Jack Warner was shaken by the 1936 murder of studio salesman Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin.
544005	Warner later described the incident in the following terms: "Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [Nazi hoodlums] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life out of him with their boots and left him dying there."
544006	Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Bros. produced films openly critical of Germany's fascist government.
544007	In 1939, the studio released Confessions of a Nazi Spy, starring Edward G. Robinson.
544008	The film project, which was recommended to Jack Warner by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, drew on the real-life experiences of agent Leon Turrou, who had worked as an undercover agent.
544009	Despite legal ramifications preventing the use of actual names, the studio aimed for an "aura of authenticity", and Hal Wallis initially recommended eliminating credits to give the film "the appearance of a newsreel."
544010	Confessions of a Nazi Spy was widely attacked.
544011	Critic Pare Lorentz wrote, "The Warner brothers have declared war on Germany with this one."
544012	The German ambassador responded by issuing a protest to U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and German dictator Adolf Hitler, who screened the film at Berchtesgaden, was outraged.
544013	Meanwhile, the studio received stern warnings from U.S. lawmaker Martin Dies about defaming a "friendly country."
553000	Elvis Aaron Presleya (January 8, 1935 - August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor.
553001	A cultural icon, he is commonly known by the single name Elvis.
553002	One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll" or "the King". Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family at the age of 13.
553003	He began his career there in 1954, working with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience.
553004	Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues.
553005	RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who went on to manage the singer for over two decades.
553006	Presley's first RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel", released in January 1956, was a number-one hit.
553007	He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records.
553008	His energized interpretations of songs, many from African-American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular-and controversial.
553009	In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender.
553010	Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work.
553011	He staged few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided.
553012	In 1968, after seven years away from the stage, he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of profitable tours.
553013	In 1973 Presley staged the first concert broadcast globally via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii.
553014	Prescription drug abuse his severely deteriorated health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42.
554000	Presley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th-century popular culture.
554001	He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres, including country, pop ballads, gospel, and blues.
554002	He is the best-selling solo artist in the history of popular music.
554003	Nominated for 14 competitive Grammys, he won three, and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36.
554004	He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.
554005	Elvis Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to 18-year-old Vernon Elvis and 22-year-old Gladys Love Presley, in the two-room shotgun house built by his father in readiness for the birth.
554006	Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before him.
554007	As an only child, Presley became close to both parents and formed an unusually tight bond with his mother.
554008	The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.
554009	Presley's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix: on his mother's side, he was Scots-Irish, with some French Norman; one of Gladys' great-great-grandmothers was Cherokee.b His father's forebears were of Scottish and German origin.
554010	Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family.
554011	Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evidencing little ambition.
554012	The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance.
554013	In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check written by the landowner.
554014	He was jailed for eight months, and Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.
554015	In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his instructors regarded him as "average". He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song "Old Shep" during morning prayers.
554016	The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance: dressed as a cowboy Presley, the ten-year-old stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth.
554017	A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else-by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle.
554018	Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church.
554019	Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it."
555000	Entering a new school, Milam, for sixth grade in September 1946, Presley was regarded as a loner.
555001	The following year, he began bringing his guitar in on a daily basis.
555002	He played and sang during lunchtime, and was often teased as a "trashy" kid who played hillbilly music.
555003	The family was by then living in a largely African-American neighborhood.
555004	A devotee of Mississippi Slim's show on the Tupelo radio station WELO, Presley was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, a classmate of Presley's, who often took him into the station.
555005	Slim supplemented Presley's guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques.
555006	When his protégé was 12 years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances.
555007	Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time, but succeeded in performing the following week.
555008	In November 1948, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee.
555009	After residing for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Courts.
555010	Enrolled at Humes High School, Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade.
555011	When his music teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise.
555012	A classmate later recalled that the teacher "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing."
555013	He was generally too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a "mama's boy". In 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior.
555014	They and three other boys-including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette-formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts.
555015	That September, he began ushering at Loew's State Theater.
555016	Other jobs followed during his school years: Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products.
556000	During his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline.
556001	On his own time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's thriving blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of Lansky Brothers.
556002	By his senior year, he was wearing them.
556003	Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual "Minstrel" show in April 1953.
556004	Singing and playing guitar, he opened with "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer.
556005	Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: "I wasn't popular in school ... I failed music-only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that."
556006	Presley, who never received formal music training or learned to read music, studied and played by ear.
556007	He frequented record stores with jukeboxes and listening booths.
556008	He knew all of Hank Snow's songs and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.
556009	The Southern Gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.
556010	He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American spiritual music.
556011	He adored the music of black gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe.
556012	Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues-of necessity, in the segregated South, only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.
556013	He certainly listened to the regional radio stations that played "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues.
556014	Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.
556015	B.B. King recalled that he knew Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.
556016	By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.
557000	In August 1953, Presley walked into the offices of Sun Records.
557001	He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: "My Happiness" and "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He would later claim he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or was merely interested in what he "sounded like", though there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store.
557002	Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.
557003	Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, "I sing all kinds."
557004	When she pressed him on whom he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, "I don't sound like nobody."
557005	After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: "Good ballad singer. Hold."
557006	Presley cut a second acetate in January 1954-"I'll Never Stand In Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"-but again nothing came of it.
557007	Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows.
557008	He explained to his father, "They told me I couldn't sing."
557009	Songfellow Jim Hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time.
557010	In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver.
557011	His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact Eddie Bond, leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist.
557012	Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving "because you're never going to make it as a singer."
557013	Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.
557014	As Keisker reported, "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'"
557015	In June, he acquired a demo recording of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenaged singer.
557016	Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice.
557017	Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew.
557018	He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield "Scotty" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.
559000	By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a substantial regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas.
559001	In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business.
559002	Parker-Dutch-born, though he claimed to be from West Virginia-had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from country singer turned Louisiana governor Jimmie Davis.
559003	Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, he was now working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow.
559004	Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.
559005	When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw Presley for the first time: "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing. ...
559006	I just didn't know what to make of it.
559007	There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it."
559008	Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride.
559009	Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network.
559010	By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer.
559011	Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both". This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay.
559012	According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a hillbilly."
559013	The blend came to be known as rockabilly.
559014	At the time, Presley was variously billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".
560000	Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.
560001	The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year.
560002	Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys.
560003	So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him.
560004	There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him.
560005	They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something."
560006	The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member.
560007	In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose "Rock Around the Clock" had been a number-one hit the previous year.
560008	Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.
560009	At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.
560010	Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him.
560011	After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.c Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract.
560012	Parker arranged with the owners of Hill and Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all of the new material recorded by Presley.
560013	Songwriters were obliged to forego one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions.
560014	d By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.
561000	On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA in Nashville.
561001	Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, to fill out the sound.
561002	The session produced the moody, unusual "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27.
561003	Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months.
561004	The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey.
561005	After his first appearance, on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio.
561006	The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, reached the top of the Billboard country chart.
561007	Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager.
561008	RCA Victor released Presley's self-titled debut album on March 23.
561009	Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety.
561010	There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune.
561011	The others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll: "Blue Suede Shoes" - "an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic Robert Hilburn-and three R & B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters.
561012	As described by Hilburn, these "were the most revealing of all.
561013	Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them.
561014	He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases."
561015	It became the first rock-and-roll album to top the Billboard chart, a position it held for 10 weeks.
561016	While Presley was not an innovative instrumentalist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argues that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music."
562000	Presley made the first of two appearances on NBC's Milton Berle Show on April 3.
562001	His performance, on the deck of the USS Hancock in San Diego, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.
562002	A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas.
562003	Twelve weeks after its Heartbreak Hotel original release, "" became Presley's first number-one pop hit.
562004	In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.
562005	The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests- "like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party", wrote a critic for Newsweek.
562006	Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.
562007	He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many days.
562008	He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas, and was struck by their cover of "Hound Dog", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.
562009	It became the new closing number of his act.
562010	After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.
562011	It warned that "Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States. ... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium. ... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph."
563000	The second Milton Berle Show appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour.
563001	Berle persuaded the singer to leave his guitar backstage, advising, "Let 'em see you, son."
563002	During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of "Hound Dog" with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements.
563003	Presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy.
563004	Television critics were outraged: Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, "Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability. ... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub. ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway."
563005	Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley. ... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos". Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared him "unfit for family viewing". To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard, comin' from an adult."
563006	The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York.
563007	Allen, no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white bow tie and black tails.
563008	Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie.
563009	As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd ... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" and simply worked the singer into the customary "comedy fabric" of his program.
563010	Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.
563011	Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show.
563012	Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. ... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music. ... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?"
564000	The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", along with "Any Way You Want Me" and "Don't Be Cruel". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s.
564001	A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."
564002	In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act.
564003	Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.
564004	The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for 11 weeks-a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.
564005	Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September.
564006	Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog", contributed "Love Me". Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten CBS's Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings.
564007	Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked the singer for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.
564008	The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers-a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.
564009	Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan recuperated from a car accident.
564010	Presley appeared in two segments that night from CBS Television City in Los Angeles.
564011	According to Elvis legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up.
564012	Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants-so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think it's a Coke bottle. ... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"
564013	Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots."
564014	In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows.
564015	Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming.
564016	Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "Love Me Tender", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.
564017	More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions.
565000	Accompanying Presley's rise to fame shift, a cultural was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize.
565001	Igniting the "biggest pop craze Presley since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra... brought rock'n'roll into the mainstream of popular culture", writes historian Marty Jezer. "As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ...Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation - the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture."
565002	The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered.
565003	Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."
565004	At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen were added to the police security to prevent crowd trouble.
565005	Elvis, Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one.
565006	Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."
565007	Presley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28.
565008	After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy.
565009	His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21.
565010	Though he was not top billed, the film's original title-The Reno Brothers-was changed to capitalize on his latest number one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month.
565011	To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role.
565012	The movie was panned by the critics but did very well at the box office.
565013	Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.
566000	On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording and jammed with them.
566001	Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure the session was captured on tape.
566002	The results became legendary as the "Million Dollar Quartet" recordings-Johnny Cash was long thought to have played as well, but he was present only briefly at Phillips' instigation for a photo opportunity.
566003	The year ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales, and Billboard's declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.
566004	In his first full year on RCA, one of the music industry's largest companies, Presley had accounted for over 50 percent of the label's singles sales.
566005	Presley made his third and final Ed Sullivan Show appearance on January 6, 1957-on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist.
566006	Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.
566007	In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out."
566008	To close Presley, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, sang a gentle black spiritual, "Peace in the Valley". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy". Two days later, the Memphis draft board announced that Presley would be classified 1A and would probably be drafted sometime that year.
567000	Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "Too Much", "All Shook Up", and "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released.
567001	Under the headline "Presley Records a Craze in Soviet", The New York Times reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad.
567002	Between film shoots and recording sessions, the singer also found time to purchase an 18-room mansion eight miles (13 km) south of downtown Memphis for himself and his parents: Graceland.
567003	Loving You-the soundtrack to his second film, released in July-was Presley's third straight number one album.
567004	The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next movie.
567005	The songwriting team effectively produced the Jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck charm". The title track was yet another number one hit, as was the Jailhouse Rock EP.
567006	Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.
567007	A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed."
567008	Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage.
567009	Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon.
567010	In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore."
567011	Asked for a response, Presley said, "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago."
586000	With the gift of a guitar from his mother he when was 12, Depp began playing in various garage bands.
586001	A year after his parents' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician.
586002	He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.
586003	He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success.
586004	The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal.
586005	Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co-wrote their song "Mary", which appeared on Rock City Angels' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man's Blues.
586006	On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, the sister of his band's bass player and singer.
586007	During Depp's marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist, while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a telemarketer for pens.
586008	His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage, who advised Depp to pursue an acting career.
586009	Depp and his wife divorced in 1985.
586010	Both Depp and his subsequent fiancé Sherilyn Fenn auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin' and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film's director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp's second major role.
586011	Depp was later turned down by the film's producer, who rejected the director's decision.
586012	Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox television series, 21 Jump Street, which premiered in 1987.
586013	Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him.
586014	Depp's long-time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish.
586015	The series' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s.
586016	Despite this success, Depp felt "forced into the role of product."
586017	Depp subsequently decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.
586018	Depp and his co-stars, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson, briefly reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series' 2012 feature film adaptation, which featured a much more comedic tone than the series.
587000	Depp's first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street, playing the boyfriend of the heroine, Nancy Thompson (played by Heather Langenkamp) and one of Freddy Krueger's victims.
587001	Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the 1986 American skater drama film Thrashin', chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film's producer.
587002	In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's Platoon.
587003	In 1990, he undertook the quirky title role of the Tim Burton film, Edward Scissorhands.
587004	The film's success began his long association with Burton.
587005	Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson, played a version of Thompson (named Raoul Duke) in 1998's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, based on the writer's pseudobiographical novel of the same name.
587006	Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.
587007	In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson, a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com.
587008	In 2008, he narrated the documentary film Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.
587009	Depp paid for most of Thompson's memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson's ashes by a cannon, in Aspen, Colorado, where Thompson lived.
587010	He returned to Thompson's work with a film adaptation of the novel The Rum Diary, released in 2011.
587011	Critics have described Depp's roles as characters who are "iconic loners."
587012	Depp has noted this period of his career was full of "studio defined failures" and films that were "box office poison," but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing.
587013	Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.
588000	The 2003 Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a major success, in which Depp's performance as the suave but shambling pirate Captain Jack Sparrow was highly praised.
588001	Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first, but the character became popular with the movie-going public.
588002	According to a survey taken by Fandango, Depp was a major draw for audiences.
588003	The film's director, Gore Verbinski, has said that Depp's character closely resembles the actor's personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards.
588004	Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role.
588005	In 2004, he was again nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance as Scottish author J. M. Barrie in the film Finding Neverland.
588006	Depp next starred as Willy Wonka in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.
588007	Depp reprised the role of Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), and On Stranger Tides (2011), which were each also major box office successes.
588008	Depp has said that Sparrow is "definitely a big part of me," and he even voiced the character in the video game Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow.
588009	His swashbuckling sword talents, as developed for the character of Sparrow, were highlighted in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade.
588010	Within the film, swordmaster Bob Anderson shared his experiences working with Depp on the choreography for The Curse of the Black Pearl.
588011	Anderson described Depp's ability as an actor to pick up the sword to be "about as good as you can get."
589000	Depp and Gore Verbinski were executive producers of the album Rogues Gallery, Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys.
589001	Depp played the title role of Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton's film adaptation of the musical, for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.
589002	Depp thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and praised Tim Burton for his "unwavering trust and support."
589003	Depp played the former Heath Ledger character in the 2009 film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus along with Jude Law and Colin Farrell.
589004	All three actors gave their salaries from the film to Ledger's daughter, Matilda.
589005	He portrayed the Mad Hatter in Burton's Alice in Wonderland, and the titular character in Rango.
589006	In 2007, Depp accepted Warner Bros.' proposal to make a film of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, a series that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971.
589007	He had been a fan as a child.
589008	Depp and Graham King produced the movie with David Kennedy, who ran Dan Curtis Productions inc. until Curtis died in 2006.
589009	Depp will film a documentary about Keith Richards.
589010	Depp will star in and produce an adaptation of the comic book Rex Mundi.
589011	Depp will collaborate with Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides director Rob Marshall again to create a remake of The Thin Man.
589012	Depp was going to star as Tonto in 2013's Lone Ranger film, but the project had been shelved because of budgetary concerns, as well as a lackluster response to the 2012 science-fiction Western Cowboys & Aliens.
589013	The project was revived and the film will be released on May 31, 2013.
589014	Depp plans to star as Carl Kolchak in the project Night Stalker, and has bought rights to the comic book The Vault.

591000	In 2004, Depp formed his production company Infinitum Nihil to develop projects where he will serve as actor and/or producer.
591001	Depp is the founder and CEO, while his sister, Christi Dembrowski, serves as president.
591002	The company's first production came in 2011 with The Rum Diary, adapted from the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson.
591003	The film is written and directed by Bruce Robinson.
591004	Also in 2011, Hugo, directed by Martin Scorsese, was released.
591005	Dark Shadows, directed by Tim Burton, was released in 2012.
591006	As a guitar player, Depp has played slide guitar on the Oasis song "Fade In-Out" (from Be Here Now, 1997), as well as on "Fade Away (Warchild Version)" (b-side of the "Don't Go Away" single). He also played acoustic guitar in the movie Chocolat and on the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
591007	He is a friend of The Pogues' Shane MacGowan, and performed on MacGowan's first solo album.
591008	He was also a member of P, a group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones.
591009	He has appeared in Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers' music video "Into the Great Wide Open" and The Lemonheads "It's a Shame About Ray" music video.

592000	Depp and Paradis grew grapes and had wine making facilities in their vineyard in Plan-de-la-Tour north of Saint-Tropez.
592001	Along with Sean Penn, John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall, Depp co-owned the French restaurant-bar Man Ray, located near the Champs-Élysées.
592002	In July 2012, Depp announced he would be co-editor, alongside Douglas Brinkley, of folk singer Woody Guthrie's unpublished novel "House of Earth", scheduled for release in 2013.
592003	Depp was married to Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985.
592004	He was later successively engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn in the late 1980s before proposing in 1990 to his Edward Scissorhands co-star Winona Ryder, for whom he tattooed "WINONA FOREVER" on his right arm.
592005	In 1998, following a four-year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss, Depp began a relationship with Vanessa Paradis, a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate.
592006	After months of media speculation, Depp and Paradis announced their separation in June 2012.
592007	Depp has two children with Paradis: daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 1999), and son John "Jack" Christopher Depp III (born 2002). In 2007, Depp's daughter recovered from a serious illness, an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay.
592008	To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital, Depp visited the hospital in November 2007, dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit, and spent four hours reading stories to the children.
592009	In 2008 he donated £1million (about $2million) to the hospital.
592010	Although Depp has not remarried, he has stated that having children has given him "real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything." "
592011	You can't plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny; kismet. All the math finally worked."
592012	While with Paradis, Depp divided his time amongst their home in Meudon, located in the suburbs of Paris; two homes in Los Angeles; an island he bought in The Bahamas; their £500,000 ($1m) townhouse in Bath, Somerset and their villa in Le Plan-de-la-Tour, a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez, in the south of France.
592013	Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan-de-la-Tour area in 2007.
592014	Several reports indicated Depp bought Burnham Westgate Hall in Norfolk, England, a 13-bedroom Georgian country house, in June 2011.
593000	In 1994, Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite.
593001	He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis.
593002	On the 16 October 2011 episode of Larry King Live, when asked by Larry King if he had faith, Depp replied, "Yes. I have faith in my kids. And I have - I have faith, you know, that as long as you keep moving forward, just keep walking forward, things will be all right, I suppose, you know. Faith in terms of religion, I don't - religion is not my specialty, you know."
593003	Depp has around 13 tattoos, many of them signifying important persons or events in his life.
593004	They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading "Wino Forever" (originally "Winona Forever", altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder) on his right biceps, "Lily-Rose" (his daughter's name) over his heart, "Betty Sue" (his mother's name) on his left biceps, and a sparrow flying over water with the word "Jack" (his son's name; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean) on his right forearm.
593005	In 2003, Depp told Germany's Stern magazine, "America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth - that can bite and hurt you, aggressive."
593006	Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, Stern stood by its story, as did CNN.com in its coverage of the interview.
593007	CNN added his remark that he would like his children "to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out."
593008	The July 17, 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the "dumb puppy" quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine.
593009	Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that perceived him as a "European wannabe", saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there.
594000	In 2011, Depp became a U.S. resident again, because France wanted him to become a permanent resident, which he said would require him to pay income tax in both countries.
594001	Depp was adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, on May 22, 2012; this makes him an honorary member of Harris's family, but not an enrolled member of the Nation.
594002	Harris, president of Americans for Indian Opportunity, invited him to join her family after hearing he would be portraying the role of Tonto as a Comanche in The Lone Ranger, a feature film scheduled for 2013 release.
594003	The ceremony took place at Harris's home; Comanche Nation Tribal Administrator Johnny Wauqua was in attendance.
594004	Depp was presented with gifts by the family, which he then presented to the attendees, as per tradition.
594005	Controversy arose over both the adoption and Depp's portrayal of a Native American character, as Depp was not raised in, nor has confirmable ancestry from, a Native American community, though he has said he "guesses" he may have some distant Cherokee or Creek ancestry.
594006	Some have wondered why he has not verified his Native American ancestry with the Cherokee or any tribe when the information is easily available.
594007	His comment that if you're Native American, "you have to think, somewhere along the line, I'm the product of some horrific rape" was believed by many Indians to be ignorant and insensitive.
594008	On the original Lone Ranger radio show, Tonto was identified as being from the Potawatomi tribe.
599000	Sir James Paul McCartney, MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and composer.
599001	With John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame as a member of the Beatles, and his collaboration with Lennon is one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century.
599002	After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career, later forming Wings with his first wife, Linda, and singer-songwriter Denny Laine.
599003	Guinness World Records described McCartney as the "most successful composer and recording artist of all time", with 60 gold discs and sales of over 100 million albums and 100 million singles, and as the "most successful songwriter" in United Kingdom chart history.
599004	More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song "Yesterday", more than any other song in history.
599005	Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK.
599006	Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in March 1999, McCartney has written, or co-written 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2013 he has sold over 15.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States.
599007	McCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music.
599008	He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, landmines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.
599009	McCartney has married three times and is the father of five children.
599010	McCartney was born on 18 June 1942, in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse.
599011	His father, James ("Jim") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II.
599012	Paul has one younger brother, Michael (born 7 January 1944). Though the children were baptised in their mother's Roman Catholic faith, their father, a former Protestant turned agnostic, felt Catholic schools sacrificed the education of their students for the sake of their religious teachings, so he and Mary did not emphasise religion in the household.
600000	McCartney had attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton.
600001	In 1953, he passed the 11-plus exam, with only three others out of ninety examinees, gaining admission to the Liverpool Institute.
600002	In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus to the Institute from his suburban home in Speke.
600003	Harrison had also passed the exam, meaning he could attend a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school, where most pupils went until becoming eligible to work.
600004	The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: "I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year younger."
600005	As the family's primary wage earner, Mary's income as a midwife had enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, where they lived until 1964.
600006	She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at "about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow". On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was fourteen, his mother died of an embolism.
600007	McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, had died when he was seventeen.
600008	A trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s, McCartney's father kept an upright piano in the front room, and he encouraged his sons to be musical.
600009	Jim gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, Paul traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar, rationalising that it would be difficult to sing while playing a trumpet.
600010	He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman also played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings.
600011	McCartney wrote his first song, "I Lost My Little Girl", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become "When I'm Sixty-Four" on the piano.
600012	Against his father's advice, he took few piano lessons, preferring to learn by ear.
600013	Heavily influenced by American rhythm and blues music his, Little Richard was schoolboy idol."
600014	Long Tall Sally" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlins holiday camp talent competition.
601000	At the age of fifteen, McCartney met Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton on 6 July 1957.
601001	The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences.
601002	The band invited McCartney to join soon afterwards as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon.
601003	Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960.
601004	By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including Beatals, Johnny and the Moondogs and the Silver Beetles.
601005	They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.
601006	Informally represented by Allan Williams, the Beatles' first booking was for a series of performances in Hamburg, starting in 1960.
601007	In 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player.
601008	They recorded professionally for the first time while in Hamburg, credited as the Beat Brothers, as the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single "My Bonnie". This brought them to the attention of Brian Epstein, a key figure in their subsequent development and success.
601009	He became their manager in January 1962.
601010	Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, "Love Me Do", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later.
601011	Their fans' hysteria became known as "Beatlemania", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the "cute Beatle". In 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition "Yesterday", featuring a string quartet.
601012	Included on the Help! LP song, the was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member."
601013	Yesterday" became the most covered song in popular music history.
601014	Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band.
601015	Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, "from  ... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director". Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics.
601016	Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue In My Life, both Lennon and McCartney claimed lead authorship for the song, "". McCartney said of the album, "we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand."
601017	Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right-Paul was absolutely finicky."
602000	In 1966, the Beatles released the album Revolver.
602001	Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of musical genres ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock album, the marked an artistic leap for the Beatles.
602002	The first of three consecutive McCartney A-sides, the single "Paperback Writer" preceded the LP's release.
602003	The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, "Rain". The films, described by Harrison as "the forerunner of videos", aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966.
602004	Revolver also included McCartney's "Eleanor Rigby", which featured a string octet.
602005	According to Gould, the song is "a neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song". With the exception of some backing vocals, the song included only McCartney's lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.
602006	The band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their 1966 US tour.
602007	Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project apart from the group-a film score for the UK production The Family Way.
602008	The score was a collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations.
602009	The soundtrack failed to chart, but it won McCartney an Ivor Novello Award for Best Instrumental Theme.
602010	Upon the end of the Beatles' performing career, McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity.
602011	He pressed them to start a new project, which became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, widely regarded as rock's first concept album.
602012	Inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured, McCartney invented the fictional band of the album's title track.
602013	As McCartney explained, "We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys we were men ... and [we] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers."
603000	Starting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album.
603001	According to engineer Geoff Emerick, "the Beatles were looking to go out on a limb, both musically and sonically ... we were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques ... limiters and ... effects like flanging and ADT."
603002	Their recording of "A Day in the Life" required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting.
603003	The sessions produced the double A-side single "Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" in February 1967, and the LP followed in June.
603004	McCartney's "She's Leaving Home" was an orchestral pop song.
603005	MacDonald described the track as "[among] the finest work on Sgt. Pepper - imperishable popular art of its time."
603006	Based on an ink drawing by McCartney cover, the LP's included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with a host of celebrities.
603007	The Beatles' heavy moustaches reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, while their clothing "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions", wrote Gould.
603008	Scholar David Scott Kastan described Sgt. Pepper as "the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded". Epstein's death in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future.
603009	McCartney, stepping in to fill that void, gradually became the de facto leader and business manager of the group Lennon had once led.
603010	His first creative suggestion after this change of leadership was to propose that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour.
603011	The project was "an administrative nightmare throughout", according to Beatles' historian Mark Lewisohn.
603012	McCartney largely directed the film, which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response.
603013	However, the film's soundtrack was more successful.
603014	It was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP), and as an identically titled LP in the US, filled out with five of the band's recent singles.
603015	The only Capitol compilation later included in the group's official canon of studio albums, the Magical Mystery Tour LP achieved $8million in sales within three weeks of its release, higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that point.
608000	McCartney collaborated with Eric Stewart on Press to Play (1986), with Stewart co-writing more than half the songs on the LP.
608001	In 1988, McCartney released Снова в СССР, released only in the Soviet Union, which contained eighteen covers; recorded over the course of two days.
608002	In 1989, he joined forces with fellow Merseysiders Gerry Marsden and Holly Johnson to record an updated version of "Ferry Cross the Mersey", for the Hillsborough disaster appeal fund.
608003	That same year, he released Flowers in the Dirt; a collaborative effort with Elvis Costello that included musical contributions from Gilmour and Nicky Hopkins.
608004	McCartney then formed a band consisting of himself and Linda, with Hamish Stuart and Robbie McIntosh on guitars, Paul "Wix" Wickens on keyboards and Chris Whitten on drums.
608005	In September 1989, they launched the Paul McCartney World Tour, his first in over a decade.
608006	The following year, he released the triple album, Tripping the Live Fantastic, which contained select performances from the tour.
608007	In 1990, the US publication Amusement Business presented McCartney with an award for the highest grossing show of the year; his two performances at Berkeley earned over $3.5 million.
608008	He performed for the largest paying stadium audience in history on 21 April 1990, when 184,000 people attended his concert at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
608009	McCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial.
608010	He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing Liverpool Oratorio.
608011	The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral.
608012	Reviews were negative.
608013	The Guardian was especially critical, describing the music as "afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo", and adding that the piece has "little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole". The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he stated, "happily, history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to ... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work."
608014	The New York Times was slightly more generous, stating, "There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany ... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions". Performed around the world after its London premiere, the Liverpool Oratorio reached number one on the UK classical chart, Music Week.
610000	Having witnessed the 11 September 2001 attacks from the JFK airport tarmac, McCartney was inspired to take a leading role in organising the Concert for New York City.
610001	His studio album release in November that year, Driving Rain, included the song "Freedom", written in response to the attacks.
610002	The following year, McCartney went out on tour with a band that included guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray, accompanied by Paul "Wix" Wickens on keyboards and Abe Laboriel, Jr. on drums.
610003	They began the Driving World Tour in April 2002, which included stops in the US, Mexico and Japan.
610004	The tour resulted in the double live album Back in the U.S., released internationally in 2003 as Back in the World.
610005	The tour earned a reported $126.2 million, an average of over $2 million per night, and Billboard named it the top tour of the year.
610006	In July 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills.
610007	In November, on the first anniversary of George Harrison's death, McCartney performed at the Concert for George.
610008	He participated in the National Football League's Super Bowl, performing "Freedom" during the pre-game show for Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 and headlining the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005.
610009	The English College of Arms honoured McCartney in 2002 by granting him a coat of arms.
610010	His crest, featuring a Liver Bird holding an acoustic guitar in its claw, reflects his background in Liverpool and his musical career.
610011	The shield includes four curved emblems which resemble beetles' backs.
610012	The arms' motto is Ecce Cor Meum, Latin for "Behold My Heart". In 2003, the McCartneys had a child, Beatrice Milly.
610013	In July 2005, he performed at the Live 8 event in Hyde Park, London, opening the show with "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (with U2) and closing it with "Drive My Car" (with George Michael), "Helter Skelter", and "The Long and Winding Road". In September, he released the rock album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, for which he provided most of the instrumentation.
610014	In 2006, McCartney released the classical work Ecce Cor Meum.
610015	The rock album Memory Almost Full followed in 2007.
610016	In 2008, he released his third Fireman album, Electric Arguments.
610017	Also in 2008, he performed at a concert in Liverpool to celebrate the city's year as European Capital of Culture.
610018	In 2009, after a four-year break, he returned to touring and has since performed over 80 shows.
610019	More than forty-five years after the Beatles first appeared on American television during The Ed Sullivan Show, he returned to the same New York theatre to perform on Late Show with David Letterman.
610020	On 9 September 2009, EMI reissued the Beatles catalogue following a four-year digital remastering effort, releasing a music video game called The Beatles: Rock Band the same day.
611000	McCartney's enduring fame has made him a popular choice to open new venues.
611001	In 2009, he played three sold-out concerts at the newly built Citi Field-a venue constructed to replace Shea Stadium in Queens, New York.
611002	These performances yielded the double live album Good Evening New York City later that year.
611003	In 2010, McCartney opened the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
611004	In July 2011, McCartney played two sold-out concerts at the new Yankee Stadium.
611005	A New York Times review of the first concert reported that McCartney was "not saying goodbye but touring stadiums and playing marathon concerts."
611006	In September 2011, having been commissioned by the New York City Ballet, McCartney released his first score for dance, a collaboration with Peter Martins called Ocean's Kingdom.
611007	Also in 2011, McCartney married Nancy Shevell.
611008	He released Kisses on the Bottom, a collection of standards, in February 2012; that same month the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences honoured him as the MusiCares Person of the Year, two days prior to his performance at the 54th Grammy Awards.
611009	As of 2013, McCartney remains one of the world's top draws.
611010	He played to over 100,000 people total during two performances in Mexico City in May, the shows grossing nearly $6million.
611011	In June 2012, McCartney closed Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Concert held outside Buckingham Palace, performing a set that included "Let It Be" and "Live and Let Die". He closed the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 27 July, singing "The End" and "Hey Jude" and inviting the audience to join in on the coda.
611012	Having donated his time, he received £1 from the Olympic organisers.
611013	On 12 December, McCartney performed, supported by Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Pat Smear (all former members of Nirvana), the closing act of 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief, seen by approximately two billion people worldwide.
612000	Largely a self-taught musician, McCartney's approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears... [A] natural melodist - a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony". McCartney commented, "I prefer to think of my approach to music as... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training."
612001	McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC.
612002	Best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle.
612003	He does not use slapping or muting techniques.
612004	He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, who McCartney called a hero for his melodic style.
612005	He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: "because he went to very unusual places". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke.
612006	During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording.
612007	While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification.
612008	During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style.
612009	He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.
612010	MacDonald identified "She's a Woman" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out Rubber Soul as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on "The Word". Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's groove on the track "a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument."
612011	MacDonald inferred the influence of James Brown's "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" and Pickett's "In the Midnight Hour", American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he "delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date".
613000	Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song "Rain" as "an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove."
613001	MacDonald considered the track the Beatles' best B-B-side, stating that its "clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney's [bassline]", which MacDonald described as "so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track". MacDonald also indicated the influence of Indian classical music in "exotic melismas in the bass part". McCartney identified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds". McCartney primarily flatpicks while playing acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of fingerpicking.
613002	Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include "Yesterday", "I'm Looking Through You", "Michelle", "Blackbird", "I Will", "Mother Nature's Son" and "Rocky Raccoon". McCartney singled out "Blackbird" as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: "I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time ... I was trying to emulate those folk players."
613003	He employed a similar technique for "Jenny Wren". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.
613004	McCartney played lead electric guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" on "Drive My Car", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino.
613005	McCartney said of the instrument, "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this."
613006	He contributed what MacDonald described as "a startling guitar solo" on the Harrison composition "Taxman" and the "shrieking" guitar on "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "Helter Skelter". MacDonald also praised McCartney's "coruscating pseudo-Indian" guitar solo on "Good Morning Good Morning". McCartney also played lead guitar on "Another Girl". On his "Taxman" solo, McCartney commented, "I was very inspired by Jimi Hendrix. It was really my first voyage into feedback."
613007	In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and David Gilmour, stating, "but I still like Hendrix the best."
613008	He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live performances.
614000	McCartney's vocals cross several musical genres.
614001	On "Call Me Back Again", according to Benitez, "McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist" while MacDonald called "I'm Down" "a rock-and-roll classic" that "illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility". MacDonald described "Helter Skelter" as an early attempt at heavy metal, and "Hey Jude" as a "pop/rock hybrid", pointing out McCartney's "use of gospel-style melismas" in the song and his "pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out". Benitez identified "Hope of Deliverance" and "Put It There" as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered "When I'm Sixty-Four" and "Honey Pie" attempts at vaudeville.
614002	MacDonald praised the "swinging beat" of the Beatles' twenty-four bar blues song, "She's a Woman" as "the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date", with McCartney's voice "at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment."
614003	MacDonald described "I've Got a Feeling" as a "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" with a "robust and soulful" vocal performance and "Back in the U.S.S.R." as "the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers", McCartney's "belting" vocals among his best since "Drive My Car", recorded three years earlier.
614004	McCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including "Every Little Thing", "She's a Woman", "For No One", "A Day in the Life", "Hello, Goodbye", "Hey Jude", "Lady Madonna", "Let It Be" and "The Long and Winding Road". MacDonald considered the piano part in "Lady Madonna" as reminiscent of Fats Domino, and "Let It Be" as having a gospel rhythm.
614005	MacDonald called McCartney's Mellotron intro on "Strawberry Fields Forever" an integral feature of the song's character.
614006	McCartney played a Moog synthesizer on the Beatles song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" and the Wings track "Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)". Ingham described the Wings songs "With a Little Luck" and "London Town" as "full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches".
615000	McCartney played drums on the Beatles' songs "Back in the U.S.S.R.", "Dear Prudence", "Martha My Dear", "Wild Honey Pie" and "The Ballad of John and Yoko". He also played all the drum parts on his first and second solo albums McCartney and McCartney II, as well as on the Wings album Band on the Run and most of the drums on his solo LP Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.
615001	In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home.
615002	They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him.
615003	Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops.
615004	He referred to the finished product as "electronic symphonies". He reversed the tapes, and speeded them up and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs "Tomorrow Never Knows" and "The Fool on the Hill". McCartney's earliest musical influences include Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry.
615005	When asked why the Beatles did not include Presley on the Sgt. Pepper cover, McCartney replied, "Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King."
615006	McCartney stated that for his bassline for "I Saw Her Standing There", he directly quoted Berry's "I'm Talking About You". McCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose falsetto vocalizations inspired McCartney's own vocal technique.
615007	McCartney said he wrote "I'm Down" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation.
615008	In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual "Buddy Holly Week" in England.
615009	The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events featuring performances by the Crickets.
63000	Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder.
63001	Ken Tucker, television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote: "Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary."
63002	The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days, and took a supporting role in the HBO television movie The Image.
63003	His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Ricky Schroder.
63004	After years of supporting roles in movies and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in the 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.
63005	He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.
63006	After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 film Cool World, although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.
63007	Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.
63008	His portrayal of the character has been described as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could be more than a "cowboy-hatted hunk."
63009	He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his "weakest performances... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for."
63010	Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew.
63011	He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better."
672000	E=MC² debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.
672001	With six number one albums, Carey is tied with Britney Spears and Janet Jackson in the United States for the third most number one albums for a female artist, behind Madonna with seven and Barbra Streisand's nine chart toppers. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked her at number six on the "Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists", making Carey the second most successful female artist in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
672002	Carey and actor/comedian Nick Cannon met while they shot her music video for her second single, "Bye Bye", on an island off the coast of Antigua.
672003	On April 30, 2008, Carey married Cannon at her private estate on Windermere Island in The Bahamas.
672004	Carey had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler's 2008 film You Don't Mess with the Zohan, playing herself.
672005	Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC², describing its production and direction in several interviews.
672006	When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough."
672007	Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.
672008	Heavy speculation suggested that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles.
672009	Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight.
672010	Carey did not address those allegations until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage.
672011	For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.
673000	On January 20, 2009, Carey performed "Hero" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.
673001	On July 7, 2009, Carey - alongside Trey Lorenz - performed her version of The Jackson 5 song "I'll Be There" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.
673002	At the sight of Jackson's casket, Carey's voice, overwhelmed with emotion, cracked in the opening line of the song.
673003	She later apologized on The Today Show, explaining how she did her best effort despite the circumstances.
673004	In 2009, she appeared as a social worker in Precious, the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel Push by Sapphire.
673005	The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, as had Carey's performance.
673006	Variety described her acting as "pitch-perfect". Precious won awards at both the Sundance Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival, receiving top honors there.
673007	In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in Precious at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.
673008	On September 25, 2009, Carey's twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, was released.
673009	Reception for the album was generally positive, but mixed in certain aspects; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it "her most interesting album in a decade", while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times criticized Carey's vocal performances, decrying her overuse of her softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers.
673010	Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and became the lowest-selling studio album of her career.
673011	The album's lead single, "Obsessed", became her 40th entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and her highest debut on the chart since "My All" in 1998.
673012	The song debuted at number eleven and peaked at number seven on the chart, and became Carey's 27th US top-ten hit, tying her with Elton John and Janet Jackson as the fifth most top-ten hits.
673013	Within hours after the song's release, various outlets speculated that its target was rapper Eminem, in response to his song "Bagpipes from Baghdad", in which he taunted Carey's husband, Nick Cannon.
673014	According to MTV, Carey alludes to drug problems in "Obsessed", which Eminem opened up about on his sixth studio album, Relapse.
673015	The album's follow-up single, a cover of Foreigner's "I Want to Know What Love Is", failed to achieve any significant chart success in the United States, or much throughout Europe, but managed to break airplay records in Brazil.
673016	The song spent 27 weeks atop the Brasil Hot 100 Airplay, making it the longest running song in the chart's history.
673017	On December 31, 2009, Carey embarked her seventh concert tour, Angels Advocate Tour, which visited the United States and Canada.
673018	Though stateside, the tour spanned few international dates, such as in Brazil and Singapore, where Carey played to over 100,000 spectators.
673019	The tour ended on September 26, 2010.
673020	On January 30, 2010, it was announced that Carey would release a remix album of Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel; titled Angels Advocate (an R&B remix album featuring a collection of newly remixed duets with some of Carey's favorite artists). The album was slated for a March 30, 2010 release, but was eventually cancelled.
674000	Following the cancellation of Angels Advocate, it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album.
674001	It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, the follow-up to Merry Christmas (1994), which became the best-selling Holiday album of all time.
674002	Longtime collaborators for the project included Jermaine Dupri, Johntá Austin, Bryan-Michael Cox and Randy Jackson, as well as new collaborators such as Marc Shaiman.
674003	Dupri stated that a single would be released alongside the album before the year's end.
674004	During a press conference in Seoul, South Korea in August 2010, Island Def Jam executive Matt Voss announced that the album would be out on November 2, 2010, and would include six new songs as well as a remix of her classic hit "All I Want for Christmas Is You". The album, titled Merry Christmas II You, was released alongside an accompanying DVD, and was sent to retailers on November 2, 2010.
674005	Merry Christmas II You debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, surpassing the opening week sales of Carey's previous holiday album of 45,000 copies 16 years prior.
674006	It also became Carey's 16th top ten album in the United States.
674007	The album debuted at number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart.
674008	In May 2010, Carey dropped out of her planned appearance in For Colored Girls, the film adaptation of the play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, citing medical reasons.

674010	On February 11, 2011, Carey announced on HSN, that she recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his Duets II album, titled "When Do The Bells Ring For Me". In March 2011, it was announced that Carey wrote a song titled "Save the Day" for her upcoming fourteenth studio album.
674011	On April 30, 2011, the couple's third wedding anniversary, Carey gave birth to fraternal twins via C-section.
674012	The twins were named Monroe, after Marilyn Monroe, and Moroccan Scott, after the location in which Cannon proposed to Carey in her Moroccan-style room; Scott is Cannon's middle name and his grandmother's maiden name.
674013	In an interview, Carey stated that her pregnancy was very difficult; she suffered from high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes.
674014	Before giving birth to the twins, she also said: "I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to walk properly again, It was a huge strain. I would sit and then someone would have to help me up. I couldn't go even to the loo by myself. It was just like, 'What are we doing? Are we going to the hospital?' No, I'm gonna stick it out, I'm gonna keep taking this medicine to keep these babies in... I made it to 35 weeks and then the doctor said it wasn't safe anymore".
675000	Following the birth of their children, Cannon revealed during an interview with Billboard that Carey had already begun working on a new record and that she's been inspired by her first two albums.
675001	Cannon said "She's been working away, and we have a studio in the crib, and [the pregnancy] has totally inspired her on so many different levels. You're definitely gonna see some new phenomenal music from Mariah" and assured Carey would plan on releasing a brand new single by the end of 2011.
675002	When asked if an album will be released by the end of 2011 as well, Cannon said that he was not sure.
675003	However, a late 2011 release for a single never materialized.
675004	In October 2011, Carey announced that she re-recorded her song "All I Want for Christmas Is You" with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe.

675006	On October 21, 2011, a pre-taped interview with Barbara Walters aired on ABC's 20/20, during the interview Carey and Cannon allowed the cameras to photograph/film twins Moroccan and Monroe for the first time.
675007	In November 2011, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single "Warning" by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy.
675008	That same month, Carey announced that she and John Legend collaborated on a duet, "When Christmas Comes", which was originally part of Carey's 2010 holiday album Merry Christmas II You.
675009	On March 1, 2012, Carey took the stage at New York City's Gotham Hall for a show, where only 50 tickets were made available to the public, as part of the Plot Your Escape concert series.
675010	This was Carey's first time performing since giving birth to twins Moroccan and Monroe.
675011	The 40-minute set included many of Carey's hits such as "Always Be My Baby", "Hero", "Obsessed", "We Belong Together", and a cover of Michael Jackson's "I'll Be There". In May 2012, Carey announced that she wrote and recorded a new song titled "Mesmerized" for Lee Daniels's 2012 movie The Paperboy.
675012	On June 14, 2012, Carey performed a three song set at a special fundraiser for United States President Barack Obama held in New York's Plaza Hotel.

Stargate) for the soundtrack of the film Oz the Great and Powerful.
675018	The video was directed by photographer David LaChapelle.
676000	On July 23, 2012, it was officially announced that Carey would be joining the judging panel of American Idol for season twelve.
676001	Her salary is reported to be $18 million.
676002	It was also announced that Carey will star in Lee Daniels' upcoming 2013 film The Butler, which is about a White House butler who served eight American Presidents over the course of three decades.
676003	The film also stars Forest Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey, Robin Williams, Melissa Leo, James Marsden, Minka Kelly, Liev Schreiber, John Cusack, Alan Rickman, and Jane Fonda.
676004	Carey said about her fourteenth studio album: "I'm collaborating with a lot of my favorite people but the main thing is [that] I'm not trying to follow any particular trend, I want it to be well received. I want to stay true to myself and the music that I love and make the fans happy". Some of the people that Carey worked with on the album include: DJ Clue?, Randy Jackson, Q-Tip, R. Kelly, David Morales, Loris Holland, Stevie J, James Fauntleroy, Ray Angry, Walter Afanasieff, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, James "Big Jim" Wright, Hit-Boy, The-Dream, Da Brat, and Rodney Jerkins.
676005	Carey gave Billboard magazine an exclusive interview in their March 9, 2013 issue, stating: "It's about making sure I have tons of good music, because at the end of the day that's the most important thing....There are alot more raw ballads than people might expect...there are also uptempo and signature-type songs that represent [my] different facets as an artist.....Wherever we go with this project, I've tried to keep the soul and heart in it"; the album was delayed to May 2013.
676006	In late March 2013, Carey stated that she "has more than enough songs" but "she's in the process of finishing things and mixing and all that". The lead single is titled "#Beautiful" and it features singer Miguel.

688000	Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, music producer, artist, and writer.
688001	He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades.
688002	Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest.
688003	A number of Dylan's early songs, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'", became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements.
688004	Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965.
688005	His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.
688006	Dylan's lyrics have incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences.
688007	They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture.
688008	Initially inspired by the performance style of Little Richard, and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres.
688009	His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored many of the traditions in American song - from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.
688010	Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica.
688011	Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour.
688012	His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.
688013	Since 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.
688014	As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame.
688015	The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power."
688016	In May 2000, Dylan was awarded the Polar Music Prize.
688017	In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.
689000	Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Iron Range west of Lake Superior.
689001	His paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the United States following the anti-Semitic pogroms of 1905.
689002	His maternal grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902.
689003	In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from Kağızman in north eastern Turkey.
689004	Dylan's parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice "Beatty" Stone, were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community.
689005	Robert Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age six, when his father was stricken with polio and the family returned to his mother's home town, Hibbing, where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood.
689006	Robert Zimmerman spent his early years listening to the radio-first to blues and country stations broadcasting from Shreveport, Louisiana, and, as a teen, to early rock and roll.
689007	Zimmerman formed several bands while attending Hibbing High School.
689008	In the Golden Chords, he performed covers of songs by Little Richard and Elvis Presley.
689009	Their performance of Danny and the Juniors' "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone off.
689010	In 1959, his high school yearbook carried the caption: "Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'." The same year, using the name Elston Gunnn [sic], he performed two dates with Bobby Vee, playing piano and providing handclaps.
689011	Zimmerman moved to Minneapolis in September 1959, where he enrolled at the University of Minnesota.
689012	His early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music; in 1985, Dylan explained the attraction that folk music had exerted on him:
690000	The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough ... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.
690001	He soon began to perform at the Ten O'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became actively involved in the local Dinkytown folk music circuit.
690002	During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as "Bob Dylan". In his autobiography, Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas.[
690003	a 1] Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked: "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."
690004	Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year (May 1960). In January 1961, he traveled to New York City, hoping to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie, who was seriously ill with Huntington's Disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.
690005	Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances.
690006	Describing Guthrie's impact on him, Dylan later wrote: "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple."
690007	As well as visiting Guthrie in the hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's acolyte Ramblin' Jack Elliott.
690008	Much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles (2004).
691000	From February 1961, Dylan played at various clubs around Greenwich Village.
691001	He befriended and picked up material from many folk singers in the Village scene, including Dave Van Ronk, Fred Neil, Odetta, the New Lost City Ramblers, and Irish musicians Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers.
691002	In September, Dylan gained some public recognition when Robert Shelton wrote a positive review in The New York Times of a show at Gerde's Folk City.
691003	The same month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester's eponymous third album, which brought his talents to the attention of the album's producer, John Hammond.
691004	Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October.
691005	The performances on his first Columbia album, Bob Dylan, released in March 1962, consisted of familiar folk, blues and gospel material combined with two original compositions.
691006	The album made little impact, selling only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even.
691007	Within Columbia Records, some referred to the singer as "Hammond's Folly" and suggested dropping his contract.
691008	Hammond defended Dylan vigorously.
691009	In March 1962, Dylan contributed harmonica and back-up vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen, accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records.
691010	While working for Columbia, Dylan also recorded several songs under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt, for Broadside Magazine, a folk music magazine and record label.
691011	Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on the 1964 anthology album, The Blues Project, issued by Elektra Records.
691012	Under the pseudonym Tedham Porterhouse, Dylan contributed harmonica to Ramblin' Jack Elliott's 1964 album Jack Elliott.
691013	Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962.
691014	He legally changed his name to Bob Dylan, and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman.
691015	Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality, and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client.
691016	Dylan subsequently said of Grossman, "He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming."
691017	Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond being replaced as the producer of Dylan's second album by the young African American jazz producer Tom Wilson.
692000	From December 1962 to January 1963, Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom.
692001	He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama, The Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television.
692002	At the end of the play, Dylan performed "Blowin' in the Wind", one of the first major public performances of the song.
692003	The film recording of The Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968.
692004	While in London, Dylan performed at several London folk clubs, including The Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies.
692005	He also learned new material from several UK performers, including Martin Carthy.
692006	By the time Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, was released in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as both a singer and a songwriter.
692007	Many of the songs on this album were labeled protest songs, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger's passion for topical songs. "
692008	Oxford Town", for example, was a sardonic account of James Meredith's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi.
692009	His most famous song at this time, "Blowin' in the Wind", partially derived its melody from the traditional slave song "No More Auction Block", while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.
692010	The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for Peter, Paul and Mary, setting a precedent for many other artists who had hits with Dylan's songs. "
692011	A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" was based on the tune of the folk ballad "Lord Randall". With its veiled references to nuclear apocalypse, it gained even more resonance when the Cuban missile crisis developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.
692012	Like "Blowin' in the Wind", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a stream-of-consciousness, imagist lyrical attack with a traditional folk form.
693000	While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, Freewheelin' also included a mixture of love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues.
693001	Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona, and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including The Beatles.
693002	George Harrison said, "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude - it was incredibly original and wonderful."
693003	The rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some early listeners but an attraction to others.
693004	Describing the impact that Dylan had on her and her husband, Joyce Carol Oates wrote: "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying."
693005	Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through more immediately palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate, as well as his lover.
693006	Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him onstage during her own concerts.
693007	Others who recorded and had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included The Byrds; Sonny and Cher; The Hollies; Peter, Paul and Mary; The Association; Manfred Mann; and The Turtles.
693008	Most attempted to impart a pop feel and rhythm to the songs, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces.
693009	The cover versions became so ubiquitous that CBS started to promote him with the tag "Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan." "
693010	Mixed Up Confusion", recorded during the Freewheelin' sessions with a backing band, was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn.
693011	In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound.
693012	Cameron Crowe described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records."
694000	In May 1963, Dylan's political profile was raised when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show.
694001	During rehearsals, Dylan had been informed by CBS Television's "head of program practices" that the song he was planning to perform, "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues", was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society.
694002	Rather than comply with the censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the program.
694003	By this time, Dylan and Baez were both prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.
694004	Dylan's third album, The Times They Are a-Changin', reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan.
694005	The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary, real life stories, with "Only A Pawn In Their Game" addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers; and the Brechtian "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.
694006	On a more general theme, "Ballad of Hollis Brown" and "North Country Blues" address the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities.
694007	This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings". By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.
694008	These tensions were publicly displayed when, accepting the "Tom Paine Award" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself (and of every man) in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.
694009	Another Side of Bob Dylan, recorded on a single June evening in 1964, had a lighter mood than its predecessor.
694010	The surreal, humorous Dylan reemerged on "I Shall Be Free No. 10" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare". "Spanish Harlem Incident" and "To Ramona" are romantic and passionate love songs, while "Black Crow Blues" and "I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. "
694011	It Ain't Me Babe", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role his reputation had thrust at him.
694012	His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic "Chimes of Freedom", which sets elements of social commentary against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by Allen Ginsberg as "chains of flashing images," and "My Back Pages", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.
695000	In the latter half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan's appearance and musical style changed rapidly, as he made his move from leading contemporary songwriter of the folk scene to folk-rock pop-music star.
695001	His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointy "Beatle boots". A London reporter wrote: "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo."
695002	Dylan also began to spar in increasingly surreal ways with his interviewers.
695003	Appearing on the Les Crane TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie.
695004	Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, "No, I play my mother."
695005	Dylan's April 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was yet another stylistic leap, featuring his first recordings made with electric instruments.
695006	The first single, "Subterranean Homesick Blues", owed much to Chuck Berry's "Too Much Monkey Business"; its free association lyrics have been described as both harkening back to the manic energy of Beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip-hop.
695007	The song was provided with an early music video which opened D. A. Pennebaker's cinéma vérité presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of Great Britain, Dont Look Back.
695008	Instead of miming to the recording, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground.
695009	Pennebaker has said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been widely imitated in both music videos and advertisements.
695010	The second side of Bringing It All Back Home consisted of four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. "
695011	Mr. Tambourine Man" quickly became one of Dylan's best known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in both the U.S. and the UK charts. "
695012	It's All Over Now Baby Blue" and "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" were acclaimed as two of Dylan's most important compositions.
696000	In 1965, as the headliner at the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed his first electric set since his high school days with a pickup group drawn mostly from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, featuring Mike Bloomfield (guitar), Sam Lay (drums) and Jerome Arnold (bass), plus Al Kooper (organ) and Barry Goldberg (piano). Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 Dylan, met with a mix of cheering and booing, left the stage after only three songs.
696001	One version of the legend has it that the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar.
696002	Murray Lerner, who filmed the performance, said: "I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric."
696003	An alternative account claims audience members were merely upset by poor sound quality and a surprisingly short set.
696004	This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival, who reports his audio recording of the concert proves that the only boos were in reaction to the emcee's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set.
696005	Nevertheless, Dylan's 1965 Newport performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.
696006	In the September issue of Sing Out!, singer Ewan MacColl wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time ...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers ... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel."
696007	On July 29, just four days after his controversial performance at Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording "Positively 4th Street". The lyrics teemed with images of vengeance and paranoia, and it was widely interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community-friends he had known in the clubs along West 4th Street.
697000	In July 1965, Dylan released the single "Like a Rolling Stone", which peaked at number two in the U.S. and at number four in the UK charts.
697001	At over six minutes, the song has been widely credited with altering attitudes about what a pop single could convey.
697002	Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that on first hearing the single, "that snare shot sounded like somebody 'dkickedso kicked open the door to your mind". In 2004 and again in 2011, Rolling Stone magazine listed it as number one on its list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". The song also opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, titled after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.
697003	The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. "
697004	Desolation Row", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass, offers the sole exception, with Dylan making surreal allusions to a variety of figures in Western culture during this epic song, described by Andy Gill as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse."
697005	In support of the record, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts and set about assembling a band.
697006	Mike Bloomfield was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band, so Dylan mixed Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew with Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, best known at the time for being part of Ronnie Hawkins's backing band The Hawks (later to become The Band). On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound.
697007	The band's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable.
698000	While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour, their studio efforts floundered.
698001	Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966, and surrounded him with a cadre of top-notch session men.
698002	At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came down from New York City to play on the sessions.
698003	The Nashville sessions produced the double-album Blonde on Blonde (1966), featuring what Dylan later called "that thin wild mercury sound". Al Kooper described the album as "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical world of Nashville and the world of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.
698004	On November 22, 1965, Dylan secretly married 25-year-old former model Sara Lownds.
698005	Some of Dylan's friends (including Ramblin' Jack Elliott) claim that, in conversation immediately after the event, Dylan denied that he was married.
698006	Journalist Nora Ephron first made the news public in the New York Post in February 1966 with the headline "Hush! Bob Dylan is wed."
698007	Dylan undertook a world tour of Australia and Europe in early 1966.
698008	Each show was split into two parts.
698009	Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.
698010	In the second half, backed by the Hawks, he played electrically amplified music.
698011	This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slow handclapped.
698012	The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17, 1966.
698013	An official recording of this concert was released in 1998: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966.
698014	At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: "Judas!"
698015	to which Dylan responded, "I don't believe you ... You're a liar!"
698016	Dylan turned to his band and said, "Play it fucking loud!"
698017	as they launched into the final song of the night - "Like a Rolling Stone."
699000	During his 1966 tour, Dylan was frequently described as exhausted and acting "as if on a death trip". D. A. Pennebaker, the film maker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else."
699001	In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, "I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things ... just to keep going, you know?"
699002	In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview which Robert Shelton had taped in 1966, Dylan claimed that he had kicked a heroin habit in New York City: "I got very, very strung out for a while ... I had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it."
699003	Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had "been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career."
699004	After his European tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures on him increased.
699005	ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show they could screen.
699006	His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a finished manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula.
699007	Manager Albert Grossman had already scheduled an extensive concert tour for that summer and fall.
699008	On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle on a road near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground.
699009	Though the extent of his injuries were never fully disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck.
699010	Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.
699011	Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the much-needed chance to escape from the pressures that had built up around him.
699012	Dylan confirmed this interpretation of the crash when he stated in his autobiography, "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race."
699013	In the wake of his accident, Dylan withdrew from the public and, apart from a few select appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.
700000	Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour for Eat the Document, a rarely exhibited follow-up to Dont Look Back.
700001	A rough cut was shown to ABC Television and was promptly rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.
700002	In 1967 he began recording music with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, called "Big Pink". These songs, initially compiled as demos for other artists to record, provided hit singles for Julie Driscoll ("This Wheel's on Fire"), The Byrds ("You Ain't Goin' Nowhere", "Nothing Was Delivered"), and Manfred Mann ("Mighty Quinn"). Columbia released selections from them in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.
700003	Over the years, more and more of the songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on various bootleg recordings, culminating in a five-CD bootleg set titled The Genuine Basement Tapes, containing 107 songs and alternate takes.
700004	In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album Music from Big Pink using songs they first worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves The Band, thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own.
700005	In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to Nashville.
700006	Back in the recording studio after a 19-month break, he was accompanied only by Charlie McCoy on bass, Kenny Buttrey on drums, and Pete Drake on steel guitar.
700007	The result was John Wesley Harding, a quiet, contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on both the American West and the Bible.
700008	The sparse structure and instrumentation, coupled with lyrics that took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, marked a departure not only from Dylan's own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture.
700009	It included "All Along the Watchtower", with lyrics derived from the Book of Isaiah (21: 5-9). The song was later recorded by Jimi Hendrix, whose version Dylan later acknowledged as definitive.
700010	Woody Guthrie died on October 3, 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by The Band.
701000	Dylan's next release, Nashville Skyline (1969), was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with Johnny Cash, and the hit single "Lay Lady Lay."
701001	Variety magazine wrote, "Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range."
701002	Dylan and Cash also recorded a series of duets, but only their recording of Dylan's "Girl from the North Country" was used on the album.
701003	In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of Johnny Cash's new television show, duetting with Cash on "Girl from the North Country", "I Threw It All Away", and "Living the Blues". Dylan next traveled to England to top the bill at the Isle of Wight rock festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the Woodstock Festival far closer to his home.
701004	In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was of varied and unpredictable quality.
701005	Rolling Stone magazine writer Greil Marcus notoriously asked "What is this shit?"
701006	on first listening to Self Portrait, released in June 1970.
701007	In general, Self Portrait, a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received.
701008	In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, which some considered a return to form.
701009	In November 1968, Dylan had co-written "I'd Have You Anytime" with George Harrison; Harrison recorded both "I'd Have You Anytime" and Dylan's "If Not for You" for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass.
701010	Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted much media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.
701011	Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's Greenwich Village.
701012	These sessions resulted in one single, "Watching the River Flow", and a new recording of "When I Paint My Masterpiece". On November 4, 1971 Dylan recorded "George Jackson", which he released a week later.
701013	For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin Prison earlier that year.
701014	Dylan contributed piano and harmony vocals to Steve Goodman's album, Somebody Else's Troubles, under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas in September 1972.
702000	In 1972, Dylan signed onto Sam Peckinpah's film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, providing songs and backing music for the movie, and playing the role of "Alias", a member of Billy's gang with some historical basis.
702001	Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" has proven its durability as one of Dylan's most extensively covered songs.
702002	Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new record label, David Geffen's Asylum Records, when his contract with Columbia Records expired.
702003	On his next album, Planet Waves, he used The Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a major tour.
702004	The album included two versions of "Forever Young", which became one of his most popular songs.
702005	As one critic described it, the song projected "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan", and Dylan himself commented: "I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental."
702006	Biographer Howard Sounes noted that Jakob Dylan believed the song was about him.
702007	Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a haphazard collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively cover songs), which was widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.
702008	In January 1974, Dylan returned to live touring after a break of seven years; backed by The Band, he embarked on a high-profile, coast-to-coast North American tour, playing 40 concerts.
702009	A live double album of the tour, Before the Flood, was released on Asylum Records.
702010	Soon, Columbia Records sent word that they "will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, apparently miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had managed to sell only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves.
702011	Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which subsequently reissued his two Asylum albums on their imprint.
703000	After the tour, Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged.
703001	He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and quickly recorded a new album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974.
703002	Dylan delayed the album's release, and re-recorded half of the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother David Zimmerman.
703003	Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews.
703004	In the NME, Nick Kent described "the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes."
703005	In Rolling Stone, reviewer Jon Landau wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness."
703006	Over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, perhaps the only serious rival to his mid-1960s trilogy of albums.
703007	In Salon.com, Bill Wyman wrote: "Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years."
703008	Novelist Rick Moody called it "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape."
703009	That summer Dylan wrote a lengthy ballad championing the cause of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, who had been imprisoned for a triple murder committed in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1966.
703010	After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote "Hurricane", presenting the case for Carter's innocence.
703011	Despite its 8:32 minute length, the song was released as a single, peaking at No.33 on the U.S. Billboard Chart, and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue, named after the Shoshone medicine man, shaman, teacher, and activist Rolling Thunder.
703012	The tour was a varied evening of entertainment featuring about one hundred performers and supporters drawn from the resurgent Greenwich Village folk scene, including T-Bone Burnett, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Joni Mitchell, David Mansfield, Roger McGuinn, Mick Ronson, Joan Baez, and violinist Scarlet Rivera, whom Dylan discovered while she was walking down the street, her violin case hanging on her back.
703013	Allen Ginsberg accompanied the troupe, staging scenes for the film Dylan was simultaneously shooting.
703014	Sam Shepard was initially hired to write the film's screenplay, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.
704000	Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album Desire, with many of Dylan's new songs featuring an almost travelogue-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright Jacques Levy.
704001	The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, Hard Rain, and the LP Hard Rain; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002's Live 1975.
704002	The 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film Renaldo and Clara, a sprawling and improvised narrative, mixed with concert footage and reminiscences.
704003	Released in 1978, the movie received generally poor, sometimes scathing, reviews and had a very brief theatrical run.
704004	Later in that year, Dylan allowed a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, to be more widely released.
704005	In November 1976, Dylan appeared at The Band's "farewell" concert, along with other guests including Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison and Neil Young.
704006	Martin Scorsese's acclaimed cinematic chronicle of this show, The Last Waltz, was released in 1978 and included about half of Dylan's set.
704007	In 1976, Dylan also wrote and duetted on the song "Sign Language" for Eric Clapton's No Reason To Cry.
704008	In 1978, Dylan embarked on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million people.
704009	For the tour, Dylan assembled an eight piece band, and was also accompanied by three backing singers.
704010	Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were recorded and released as the live double album, Bob Dylan At Budokan.
704011	Reviews were mixed.
704012	Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review, while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: "These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals."
704013	When Dylan brought the tour to the US in September 1978, he was dismayed the press described the look and sound of the show as a 'Las Vegas Tour'. The 1978 tour grossed more than $20 million, and Dylan acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times that he had some debts to pay off because "I had a couple of bad years. I put a lot of money into the movie, built a big house ... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California."
705000	In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same large band and backing vocalists into Rundown Studios, a rehearsal space Dylan had rented in Santa Monica, California, to record an album of new material: Street-Legal.
705001	It was described by Michael Gray as, "after Blood On The Tracks, arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life". However, it suffered from poor sound recording and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.
705002	In the late 1970s, Dylan became a born-again Christian and released two albums of Christian gospel music.
705003	Slow Train Coming (1979) featured the guitar accompaniment of Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) and was produced by veteran R&B producer, Jerry Wexler.
705004	Wexler recalled that when Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording, he replied: "Bob, you're dealing with a sixty-two-year old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album."
705005	The album won Dylan a Grammy Award as "Best Male Vocalist" for the song "Gotta Serve Somebody". The second evangelical album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, and was described by Dylan critic Michael Gray as "the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior."
705006	When touring in late 1979 and early 1980 Dylan, would not play any of his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as: Years ago they ... said I was a prophet.
705007	I used to say, "No I'm not a prophet" they say "Yes you are a prophet, you're."
705008	I said, "No it's not me."
705009	They used to say "You sure are a prophet."
705010	They used to convince me I was a prophet.
705011	Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer.
705012	They say, "Bob Dylan's no prophet."
705013	They just can't handle it.
706000	Dylan's embrace of born-again Christianity was unpopular with some of his fans and fellow musicians.
706001	Shortly before his murder, John Lennon recorded "Serve Yourself" in response to Dylan's "Gotta Serve Somebody". By 1981, Stephen Holden wrote in the New York Times that "neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament."
706002	In late 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring for a series of concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective", where he restored several of his popular 1960s songs to the repertoire.
706003	Shot of Love, recorded the next spring, featured Dylan's first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs.
706004	The song "Every Grain of Sand" reminded some critics of William Blake's verses.
706005	In the 1980s the reception of Dylan's recorded work varied, from the well-regarded Infidels in 1983 to the panned Down in the Groove in 1988.
706006	Critics such as Michael Gray condemned Dylan's 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.
706007	As an example of the latter, the Infidels recording sessions, which again employed Mark Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs which Dylan left off the album.
706008	Most well regarded of these were "Blind Willie McTell", a tribute to the dead blues musician and an evocation of African American history, "Foot of Pride" and "Lord Protect My Child". These three songs were later released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991.
706009	Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded Empire Burlesque.
706010	Arthur Baker, who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper, was asked to engineer and mix the album.
706011	Baker has said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound "a little bit more contemporary".
707000	Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief fundraising single "We Are the World". On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia.
707001	Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, Dylan performed a ragged version of "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: "I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks."
707002	His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.
707003	In April 1986, Dylan made a brief foray into the world of rap music when he added vocals to the opening verse of "Street Rock", a song featured on Kurtis Blow's album Kingdom Blow.
707004	Dylan's next studio album, Knocked Out Loaded, was released in July 1986 and contained three cover songs (by Little Junior Parker, Kris Kristofferson and the traditional gospel hymn "Precious Memories"), plus three collaborations with other writers (Tom Petty, Sam Shepard and Carole Bayer Sager), and two solo compositions by Dylan.
707005	One reviewer commented that "the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating."
707006	It was the first Dylan album since Freewheelin' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.
707007	Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, 'Brownsville Girl', a work of genius.
708000	In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured extensively with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night.
708001	Dylan also toured with The Grateful Dead in 1987, resulting in a live album Dylan & The Dead.
708002	This album received some very negative reviews: Allmusic said, "Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead."
708003	After performing with these musical permutations, Dylan initiated what came to be called The Never Ending Tour on June 7, 1988, performing with a tight back-up band featuring guitarist G. E. Smith.
708004	Dylan would continue to tour with a small, constantly evolving band for the next 20 years.
708005	In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up-rock-star-turned-chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation (played by Rupert Everett). Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack - "Night After Night", and "I Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.
708006	Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introductory speech declaring, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.
708007	When Dylan released the album Down in the Groove in May 1988, it was even more unsuccessful in its sales than his previous studio album.
708008	Michael Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant."
708009	The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys.
708010	Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached number three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.
708011	Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, which they released with the unexpected title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.
709000	Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.
709001	Dylan critic Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s."
709002	The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.
709003	The religious imagery of "Ring Them Bells" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.
709004	Dylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky (1990), an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy.
709005	The album contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo"; this was later explained as a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four at that time.
709006	Sidemen on the album included George Harrison, Slash from Guns N' Roses, David Crosby, Bruce Hornsby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Elton John.
709007	Despite the stellar line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.
709008	In 1991, Dylan was honored by the recording industry with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson.
709009	The event coincided with the start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed his song "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech that startled some of the audience.
709010	The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: Good as I Been to You (1992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work.
709011	Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim", penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence.
709012	In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged.
709013	He claimed his wish to perform a set of traditional songs for the show was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on a greatest hits package.
709014	The album produced from it, MTV Unplugged, included "John Brown", an unreleased 1963 song detailing the ravages of both war and jingoism.
710000	With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch, Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997.
710001	The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.
710002	Late that spring, before the album's release, Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis.
710003	His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon."
710004	He was back on the road by midsummer, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy.
710005	The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric "Blowin' in the Wind". September saw the release of the new Lanois-produced album, Time Out of Mind.
710006	With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed.
710007	One critic wrote: "the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years."
710008	This collection of complex songs won him his first solo "Album of the Year" Grammy Award.
710009	In December 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the White House, paying this tribute: "He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful."
710010	Dylan commenced the new millennium by winning the Polar Music Prize in May 2000 and his first Oscar; his song "Things Have Changed", penned for the film Wonder Boys, won an Academy Award in March 2001.
710011	The Oscar, by some reports a facsimile, tours with him, presiding over shows perched atop an amplifier.
711000	"Love and Theft" was released on September 11, 2001.
711001	Recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album himself under the pseudonym Jack Frost.
711002	The album was critically well received and earned nominations for several Grammy awards.
711003	Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly, Western swing, jazz, and even lounge ballads. "
711004	Love and Theft" generated controversy when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the album's lyrics and Japanese author Junichi Saga's book Confessions of a Yakuza.
711005	In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his "born again" period and participated in the CD project Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan.
711006	That year also saw the release of the film Masked & Anonymous, which Dylan co-wrote with director Larry Charles under the alias Sergei Petrov.
711007	Dylan played the central character in the film, Jack Fate, alongside a cast which included Jeff Bridges, Penélope Cruz and John Goodman.
711008	The film polarised critics: many dismissed it as an "incoherent mess"; a few treated it as a serious work of art.
711009	In October 2004, Dylan published the first part of his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One.
711010	The book confounded expectations.
711011	Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961-1962, virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height.
711012	He also devoted chapters to the albums New Morning (1970) and Oh Mercy (1989). The book reached number two on The New York Times' Hardcover Non-Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a National Book Award.
711013	No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's acclaimed film biography of Dylan, was first broadcast on September 26-27, 2005, on BBC Two in the UK and PBS in the US.
711014	The documentary focuses on the period from Dylan's arrival in New York in 1961 to his motorcycle crash in 1966, featuring interviews with Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Pete Seeger, Mavis Staples, and Dylan himself.
711015	The film received a Peabody Award in April 2006 and a Columbia-duPont Award in January 2007.
711016	The accompanying soundtrack featured unreleased songs from Dylan's early career.
712000	Dylan earned yet another distinction in a 2007 study of US legal opinions and briefs that found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers more than those of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by The Beatles, who were second.
712001	Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives.
712002	The most widely cited lines included "you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows" from "Subterranean Homesick Blues" and "when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose" from "Like a Rolling Stone". May 3, 2006, was the premiere of Dylan's radio presenting career, hosting a weekly radio program, Theme Time Radio Hour, for XM Satellite Radio, with song selections revolving around a chosen theme.
712003	Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1930s to the present day, including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur, Prince, L.L. Cool J and The Streets.
712004	The show was praised by fans and critics as "great radio," as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor, while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices.
712005	In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was "Goodbye" and the final record played was Woody Guthrie's "So Long, It's Been Good To Know Yuh". This has led to speculation that Dylan's radio series may have ended.
712006	On August 29, 2006, Dylan released his Modern Times album.
712007	Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing on the album as "a catarrhal death rattle") most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing Time Out of Mind and "Love and Theft". Modern Times entered the U.S. charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire.
712008	The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.
725000	In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with.
725001	While shooting Gia, she told her then-husband Jonny Lee Miller that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"
725002	After Gia wrapped in 1997, Jolie announced that she had given up acting for good, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give."
725003	She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she enrolled at New York University to study filmmaking and attend writing classes; she later described it as "just good for me to collect myself."
725004	Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, she resumed her career.
725005	Jolie returned to film in the 1998 gangster movie Hell's Kitchen.
725006	Later that year, she appeared in Playing by Heart, part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillippe, and Jon Stewart.
725007	The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular.
725008	The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, "Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."
725009	Jolie won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.
725010	In 1999, she starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett.
725011	The film received a mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's characterâ   Thornton's seductive wifeâ   was particularly criticized.
725012	The Washington Post wrote, "Mary (Angelina Jolie) [is] a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."
725013	She then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), an adaptation of a crime novel by Jeffery Deaver.
725014	Jolie played a police officer haunted by her cop father's suicide, who reluctantly helps Washington track down a serial killer.
725015	The movie grossed $151 million worldwide, but was a critical failure.
725016	The Detroit Free Press concluded, "Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast."
726000	Jolie next took the supporting role of the sociopathic mental patient Lisa Rowe in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of author Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name.
726001	While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.
726002	She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
726003	Variety noted, "Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation."
726004	In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone In 60 Seconds, in which she played Sarah "Sway" Wayland, the ex-girlfriend of car thief Nicolas Cage.
726005	The role was small, and The Washington Post criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."
726006	She later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after the emotionally heavy role of Lisa Rowe.
726007	It became her highest-grossing movie to that point, earning $237 million internationally.
726008	Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie's films to date had often not appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar.
726009	An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogame, Jolie was required to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the title role of Lara Croft.
726010	She was generally praised for her physical performance, but the movie generated mostly negative reviews.
726011	Slant commented, "Angelina Jolie was born to play Lara Croft but [director] Simon West makes her journey into a game of Frogger."
726012	The movie was an international success nonetheless, earning $275 million worldwide, and launched her global reputation as a female action star.
727000	Jolie then starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), a thriller based on the novel Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich.
727001	The film was a major critical failure, with The New York Times noting, "The story plunges more precipitously than Ms. Jolie's neckline."
727002	In 2002, she starred in Life or Something Like It as an ambitious television reporter who is told that she will die in a week.
727003	The film was poorly received by critics, though Jolie's performance received positive reviews.
727004	CNN's Paul Clinton wrote, "Jolie is excellent in her role. Despite some of the ludicrous plot points in the middle of the film, this Academy Award-winning actress is exceedingly believable in her journey towards self-discovery and the true meaning of fulfilling life."
727005	Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), which established her among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses.
727006	The sequel was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156 million at the international box office.
727007	She appeared in the music video for Korn's "Did My Time", which was used to promote the film.
727008	She next starred in Beyond Borders (2003), as a socialite who joins aid workers in Africa and Asia.
727009	The film reflected Jolie's real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, but it was critically and financially unsuccessful.
727010	The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Jolie, as she did in her Oscar-winning role in Girl, Interrupted, can bring electricity and believability to roles that have a reality she can understand.
727011	She can also, witness the Lara Croft films, do acknowledged cartoons. But the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her."
727012	In 2004, Jolie starred alongside Ethan Hawke in the thriller Taking Lives.
727013	She portrayed an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer.
727014	The movie received mixed reviews and The Hollywood Reporter concluded, "Angelina Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour."
727015	She also provided the voice of the angelfish Lola in the DreamWorks animated movie Shark Tale (2004), and had a brief appearance in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), a science fiction adventure film shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen.
727016	That same year, Jolie played Olympias in Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great.
727017	The film failed domestically, which director Oliver Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, with revenue of $139 million outside the United States.
728000	Jolie then starred opposite Brad Pitt in the 2005 action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which tells the story of a bored married couple, John and Jane Smith, who find out that they are both secret assassins.
728001	The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads.
728002	The Star Tribune noted, "While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."
728003	The movie earned $478 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest grossing film of 2005.
728004	Jolie next appeared in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), a film about the early history of the CIA, as seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson, an officer based on James Jesus Angleton and played by Matt Damon.

730004	The film, which Jolie also scripted and co-produced, aroused both praise and criticism in the Balkans; the response from Bosniak war-victims advocacy organizations was "overwhelmingly positive," while a Serb war prisoners group decried the film for its alleged anti-Serb bias.

806000	Paul and Linda were vegetarians for most of their 30-year marriage.
806001	They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb.
806002	Soon after, the couple became outspoken animal rights activists.
806003	In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent £3,000,000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients.
806004	In 1995, he narrated the documentary Devour the Earth, written by Tony Wardle.
806005	McCartney is a supporter of the animal-rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

806007	McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, the World Society for the Protection of Animals, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation.
806008	Following McCartney's marriage to Mills, he joined her in a campaign against landmines, becoming a patron of Adopt-A-Minefield.
806009	He wore an anti-landmines T-shirt during some of the Back in the World tour shows.
806010	In 2006, the McCartneys travelled to Prince Edward Island to raise international awareness of seal hunting.

807000	In 2009, McCartney wrote to Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, asking him why he was not a vegetarian.
807001	As McCartney explained, "He wrote back very kindly, saying, my doctors tell me that I must eat meat. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right ... I think he's now being told ... that he can get his protein somewhere else ... It just doesn't seem right   the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings ... Oh, and by the way, I'm having a steak.'"
807002	On the eve of the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election, McCartney issued a video endorsement of President Barack Obama.
807003	In August 1967, McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton, and later went to Bangor in North Wales, to attend a weekend initiation conference, where he and the other Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation.
807004	He explained, "The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra ... I find it soothing". In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall, raising three million dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.
807005	McCartney has publicly professed support for Everton, and also shown favour for Liverpool.
807006	In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, "Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'"
808000	McCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dot Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959.
808001	According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations.
808002	He often chose clothes and make-up for her, encouraging her to grow her hair out like Brigitte Bardot's, and at least once insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect.
808003	When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962.
808004	The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now "free of obligation", ended the engagement.
808005	McCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
808006	The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London.
808007	They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in St. John's Wood, in March 1966.
808008	He wrote several songs while living at the Ashers', including "Yesterday", "And I Love Her", "You Won't See Me" and "I'm Looking Through You", the latter three having been inspired by their romance.
808009	They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become involved with Francie Schwartz.
808010	Linda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, "all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio."
808011	At times, she skipped school to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry.
808012	She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966.
808013	She commented, "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked."
808014	The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.
808015	As Paul remembers, "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night!"
808016	Linda said this about their meeting: "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night] ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up."
808017	The pair married in 1969.
808018	About their relationship, Paul said, "We had a lot of fun together ... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment."
808019	He added, "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off ... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did."
