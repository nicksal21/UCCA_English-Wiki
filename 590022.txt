In the DVD Reviews section , Entertainment Weekly 's Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus , stating , " Depp 's soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he 's been hiding ... Watching Depp 's barber wield his razors ... it 's hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago ... and all of the twisted beauty we would 've missed out on had [ Burton and Depp ] never met .
