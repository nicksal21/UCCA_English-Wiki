In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone , Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was " the biggest mistake I ever made " and " I was always a closet heterosexual " . On other occasions , he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than his own feelings ; as described by Buckley , he said he had been driven more by " a compulsion to flout moral codes than a real biological and psychological state of being " . Asked in 2002 by Blender whether he still believed his public declaration was the biggest mistake he ever made , he replied : Interesting . [ Long pause ] I do n't think it was a mistake in Europe , but it was a lot tougher in America . I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual . But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people . I knew what I wanted to be , which was a songwriter and a performer , and I felt that bisexuality became my headline over here for so long . America is a very puritanical place , and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do .
