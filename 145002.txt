# ::tok Roger Ebert noted that it was the first time Hepburn had looked frail , but that the " magnificent spirit " was still there and said her scenes " steal the show " . The New York Times made similar observations as they reflected on the actress 's final big - screen appearance , stating that " if she moved more slowly than before , in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been " . Hepburn filmed one final role in the television movie One Christmas ( 1994 ) , for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old .
