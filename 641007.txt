Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned follow - up album Milk and Honey ( released posthumously in 1984 ) . Released jointly with Ono , Double Fantasy was not well received , drawing comments such as Melody Maker 's " indulgent sterility ... a godawful yawn " . At around 10 : 50 pm on 8 December 1980 , as Lennon and Ono returned to their New York apartment in The Dakota , Mark David Chapman shot Lennon in the back four times at the entrance to the building .
