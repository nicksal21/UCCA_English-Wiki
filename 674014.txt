I would sit and then someone would have to help me up . I could n't go even to the loo by myself . It was just like , ' What are we doing ? Are we going to the hospital ? ' No , I 'm gonna stick it out , I 'm gonna keep taking this medicine to keep these babies in ... I made it to 35 weeks and then the doctor said it was n't safe anymore " .
