Before Sunset , the Linklater - directed sequel to Before Sunrise which Hawke co - wrote with Linklater and Delpy , was more successful , with a contributor of The Hartford Courant reporting that the three collaborators keep Hawke and Delpy 's characters " iridescent and fresh " , concluding that they are the most delightful and moving of all romantic movie couples .
