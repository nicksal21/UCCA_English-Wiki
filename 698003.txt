The Nashville sessions produced the double - album Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) , featuring what Dylan later called " that thin wild mercury sound " . Al Kooper described the album as " taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion " : the musical world of Nashville and the world of the " quintessential New York hipster " Bob Dylan .
