Why not just tell people I 'm an alien from Mars ? Tell them I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight . They 'll believe anything you say , because you 're a reporter . But if I , Michael Jackson , were to say , " I 'm an alien from Mars and I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight , " people would say , " Oh , man , that Michael Jackson is nuts . He 's cracked up . You ca n't believe a single word that comes out of his mouth .
