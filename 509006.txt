Although the track was edited out of the final cut , it was later re - recorded and released as " Safe " on the B - side of Bowie 's 2002 single " Everyone Says ' Hi ' " . The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited - edition single release version of Placebo 's track " Without You I 'm Nothing " , co - produced by Visconti , with Bowie 's harmonised vocal added to the original recording .
