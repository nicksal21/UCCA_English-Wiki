# ::tok Hawke said of the novel , " Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college , and with being an actor . I did n't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines . I wanted to try making something else . It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did . And it was just one of the best things I ever did .
