When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress , she said , " People think that if you look fairly reasonable , you ca n't possibly act , and as I only care about acting , I think beauty can be a great handicap , if you really want to look like the part you 're playing , which is n't necessarily like you . "
