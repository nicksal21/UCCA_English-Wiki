Hawke said that he was drawn to the play 's take on " the nature of reality " , and its " weird juxtaposition of humor and mysticism " . In his review for the New York Times , Ben Brantley noted the production 's " scary , splendid clarity " , and praised Hawke for providing his cast " with a mood - stirring mise en sc√®ne " and , moreover , for eliciting a performance that " connoisseurs of precision acting will be savoring for years to come " . Entertainment Weekly commented that although A Lie of the Mind " wobbles a bit in its late stages " , Hawke 's " hearty " revival managed to " resurrect the spellbinding uneasiness of the original " . The production garnered five Lucille Lortel Award nominations including Outstanding Revival , and earned Hawke a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Director of a Play .
