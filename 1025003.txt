In 1981 , McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for £ 20 million ( $ 40 million ) . According to McCartney , he contacted Yoko Ono about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost equally at £ 10 million each , but Ono thought they could buy it for £ 5 million each . When they were unable to make the joint purchase , McCartney let the offer fall through , not wanting to be the sole owner of the Beatles ' songs .
