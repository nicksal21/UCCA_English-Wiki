Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt 's Oblique Strategies cards : " Boys Keep Swinging " entailed band members swapping instruments , " Move On " used the chords from Bowie 's early composition " All the Young Dudes " played backwards , and " Red Money " took backing tracks from " Sister Midnight " , a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop .
