" Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music " has reached its lowest depths in the ' grunt and groin ' antics of one Elvis Presley . ... Elvis , who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar , tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos " . Ed Sullivan , whose own variety show was the nation 's most popular , declared him " unfit for family viewing " . To Presley 's displeasure , he soon found himself being referred to as " Elvis the Pelvis " , which he called " one of the most childish expressions I ever heard , comin ' from an adult . "
