Paul has one younger brother , Michael ( born 7 January 1944 ) . Though the children were baptised in their mother 's Roman Catholic faith , their father , a former Protestant turned agnostic , felt Catholic schools sacrificed the education of their students for the sake of their religious teachings , so he and Mary did not emphasise religion in the household .
