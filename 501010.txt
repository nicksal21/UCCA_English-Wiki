Featuring a starkly lit set , the Isolar - 1976 Tour highlighted songs from the album , including the dramatic and lengthy title track , the ballads " Wild Is the Wind " and " Word on a Wing " , and the funkier " TVC 15 " and " Stay " . The core band that coalesced around this album and tour - rhythm guitarist Alomar , bassist George Murray , and drummer Dennis Davis - continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s .
