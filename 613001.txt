MacDonald considered the track the Beatles ' best B - B - side , stating that its " clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney 's [ bassline ] " , which MacDonald described as " so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track " . MacDonald also indicated the influence of Indian classical music in " exotic melismas in the bass part " . McCartney identified Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing , particularly on " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds " .
