MacDonald also indicated the influence of Indian classical music in " exotic melismas in the bass part " . McCartney identified Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing , particularly on " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds " . McCartney primarily flatpicks while playing acoustic guitar , though he also uses elements of fingerpicking .
