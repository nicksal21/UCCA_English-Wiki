The Beatles ' song " Getting Better " , he said , told his own story , " I used to be cruel to my woman , and physically - any woman . I was a hitter . I could n't express myself and I hit . I fought men and I hit women . That is why I am always on about peace " . Recalling his reaction in July 1962 on learning that Cynthia was pregnant , Lennon said , " There 's only one thing for it Cyn . We 'll have to get married . "
