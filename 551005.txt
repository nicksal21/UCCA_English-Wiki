As one biographer observed , Warner " was furious when Humphrey Bogart , Lauren Bacall , Paul Henreid and John Huston joined other members of the stellar Committee for the First Amendment in a flight to Washington to preach against the threat to free expression " . Lester D . Friedman noted that Warner 's response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who " feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry " . Warner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full - page ads in The New York Times " to proclaim why Nixon should be elected " . In the wake of Nixon 's loss to John F . Kennedy , however , the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium in honor of the president - elect .
