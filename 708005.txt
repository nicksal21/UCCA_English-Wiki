In 1987 , Dylan starred in Richard Marquand 's movie Hearts of Fire , in which he played Billy Parker , a washed - up - rock - star - turned - chicken farmer whose teenage lover ( Fiona ) leaves him for a jaded English synth - pop sensation ( played by Rupert Everett ) . Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack - " Night After Night " , and " I Had a Dream About You , Baby " , as well as a cover of John Hiatt 's " The Usual " . The film was a critical and commercial flop .
