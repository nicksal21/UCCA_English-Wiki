Leading contemporary composer Philip Glass described Low as " a work of genius " in 1992 , when he used it as the basis for his Symphony No . 1 " Low " ; subsequently , Glass used Bowie 's next album as the basis for his 1996 Symphony No . 4 " Heroes " . Glass has praised Bowie 's gift for creating " fairly complex pieces of music , masquerading as simple pieces " .
