McCartney said , " I 've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon . So I 'm really excited about it . I did n't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I 'm out of the closet " . McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts , a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys .
